I'm with the Boryokudan. (lie)
난 보료쿠단과 일하고 있어요.(거짓말)
I'm his brother. (lie)
난 그의 형제예요.(거짓말)
I'm his co-worker. (lie)
난 그의 직장 동료예요(거짓말)
%d
%d
&95 The Boryokudan doesn't take too kindly to cops, especially ones from out of the system, if you know what I mean.
&95 보료쿠단은 경찰들에게 친절하지 않거든요. 특히 이 행성계 밖에서 온 사람에게는요, 내 말이 무슨 뜻인지 아신다면.
&94 If you're gonna be walking the streets, you'd better watch yourself.
&94 거리를 걸을 생각이라면, 조심하는 게 좋을 거에요.
&9 Something's off... his breathing is starting to become irregular...
&9 뭔가 이상합니다... 호흡이 불규칙해지기 시작했어요...
&8 I still don't see why we can't just let him keep this memory.
&8 전 아직도 왜 그냥 그의 이 기억을 그대로 두면 안 되는지 모르겠어요.
&7 I'm a police officer.
&7 난 경찰이에요.
&7 Is he okay?
&7 그는 괜찮은가요?
&6 Um... what are we supposed to do if he's conscious?
&6 음... 의식이 있는 것 같은데 어떻게 하면 좋을까요?
&54 She wasn't supposed to die.
&54 그녀는 죽으면 안 됐어.
&535 Understood.
&535 알겠어요.
&53 If they try to escape again, don't kill them next time.
&53 그들이 또 도망치려고 한다면, 다음부터는 죽이지는 말게.
&52 Then I'd have to retrain him all over again...
&52 인지영역까지 지워버리면 난 그를 다시 재훈련시켜야 하거든...
&51 Assuming you two don't wipe those areas as well.
&51 당연히 이 인지 영역은 지우지 않아야 하네.
&50 Delta-Six, you're in our hands now.
&50 델타 식스, 자네는 이제 우리 손 안에 있어.
&49 Assuming you both did your jobs correctly, for once.
&49 이번에는 너희 둘이 제대로 일을 한 것 같군.
&260 Initiating Memory Wipe...
&260 기억 청소 초기화...
&259 1....
&259 1....
&258 2....
&258 2....
&257 3....
&257 3....
&256 Initiating Memory Wipe... in T-Minus...
&256 기억 청소 초기화 중입니다...
&20 If they try to escape again, they'll have some pre-existing knowledge to help them get out.
&20 만약 그들이 다시 탈출을 시도한다면, 탈출에 도움이 되는 기존의 지식을 갖게 될 것입니다.
&19 As I was saying...
&19 제가 말씀드렸지만...
&18 Any skills he learned are kept in his cognition areas, not memory banks.
&18 그가 배운 기술은 기억 저장소가 아니라, 인지 영역에 간직됩니다.
&17 There is no reason to let him keep the memories of his escape.
&17 도망의 기억을 갖게 할 이유는 없습니다.
&166 ARGH!
&166 아악!
&16 Proceed to memory wipe in T-Minus 60 seconds...
&16 60초 후에 기억 청소가 진행될 겁니다….
&15 Subject is stable...
&15 대상의 상태는 안정적입니다….
&140 Ugh...
&140 음...
&14 He's fine...
&14 그의 상태는 양호합니다...
&13 Vitals are stable.
&13 바이탈은 안정적입니다.
&12 It doesn't matter. It'll only be a second.
&12 문제되지 않습니다. 몇초면 끝납니다.
&11 Okay, here we go.
&11 좋아... 시작하지.
????
????
&815 Matthius Howard... Where are you...
&815 마티우스 하워드…. 어디 있는 거냐….
&814 Azriel out.
&814 나중에 연락할께.
&813 Alright... I'll start looking through the city. I'll probably have to ask one of the locals. He moves all the time.
&813 좋아... 도시를 살펴보겠어. 아마 현지인에게 물어봐야겠지. 그는 늘 움직이고 있으니.
&812 What do you want me to do?
&812 내가 무얼 하면 되지?
&811 He's not with the Boryokudan anymore, I told you.
&811 그는 더 이상 보료쿠단이랑 일 안 해. 내가 말했잖아.
&810 ...Something's wrong... he should've been here by now.
&810 …뭔가가 잘못됐어…. 그는 지금쯤 여기 있었어야 하는데.
&1034 Kane. Looks like the Boryokudan knew about our extraction. They just cleared out Matthius' apartment.
&1034 케인. 보료쿠단이 우리의 추출 작업에 대해 안 모양이야. 그들은 방금 마티우스의 집을 확인했어.
&1035 Check the communication codes for my current location.
&1035 내 현재 위치의 커뮤니케이션 코드를 확인해 봐.
&1036 Got anything?
&1036 맞지?
&135 Got something. Yep... It looks like the Boryokudan, but I'm not sure.
&135 그래. 응.. 보료쿠단 같네. 하지만 확신은 못하겠어.
&136 What's going on here?
&136 대체 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는거지?
&1037 I don't know, but it looks like Matthius left here a long time ago.
&1037 모르겠어. 그렇지만 마티우스는 오래 전에 여길 떠난 것 같아.
&1038 I'll try to contact him and see if they're still in the city.
&1038 그와 연락을 시도해 보고 아직 이 도시에 있는지 알아볼께.
&123 People change in five years...
&123 사람은 5년이나 지났다면 변하지…
&124 We're already an hour late. I can't stay in orbit unnoticed forever.
&124 이미 한시간이나 늦었어. 계속해서 여기서 들키지 않은 채로 머무를 순 없어.
&125 Find him. Get a new extraction point or we're getting out of here.
&125 그를 찾아. 새로운 추출 지점을 얻는다면 우린 여기서 나갈 수 있을 거야.
&126 Alright. One more hour. I'll be waiting.
&126 알았어. 한 시간 더 기다리도록 하지.
&809 Kane...
&809 케인….
&122 Yes, Azriel?

If I'm going to be doing any detective work, I'd want to fix my lock picks. However, these lock picks are one of a kind--I got them for my initiation almost ten years ago--so they can't be fixed by conventional means. I need a Carbon Ray Stabilizer to fix them. It's rare, but I might be able to find one around here.

Reportedly an ex-assassin who worked with the Boryokudan has been feeding information to the Taurus police, prompting the fight against crime. Gemini jurisdiction however, prevents him from coming here.

Three men were reported dead and two missing after a shootout in New Pittsburg yesterday evening. The reported gunman escaped from authorities, some say jumping ship back to Taurus. It is unknown at this time if the assailant was from Gemini or not, which would violate the treaty's jurisdiction.

Juice is the slang term for a banned hallunicatory drug, since reintroduced in the New World, and now has become ever more popular among drug-users across the galaxies. Low grade juice gives users a temporary high which in some cases renders the user unconscious. On the other hand, high grade juice has been known to be an adrenaline booster.

&1 Hello, my name is Joshua Nuernberger and I am the writer, designer, and developer of Gemini Rue. Initially, Gemini Rue started out as a personal project, which at the time was titled 'Boryokudan Rue.' However, after working on it for several years and getting much feedback, I decided to publish it commercially even though it was only a student work.  Since then, it has expanded to a collaboration with Wadjet Eye Games and developer Dave Gilbert.

&4 1/1: Originally, this introduction was not in the game, but later it was added for several reasons. First, in terms of story, it establishes Delta-Six as a protagonist and sets up his relation to the main 'villain' of the story, the Director. It also functions as the plot's inciting incident by wiping the memory of Delta-Six and setting off the story, putting the next scene with Azriel in a broader perspective.

&6 1/9: This environment started with the idea of a man, alone, waiting under a rainy awning in a desolated city. This proposes the question: why is he there, what is he waiting for, how did he get there, and so on. In answering these questions, it creates an anchor point in which to simultaneously branch off in order to create the rest of the game's narrative.

&8 3/9: Before it can be fully developed, a new gameplay mechanic must first be used by players in an introductory sense. With the 'kick' verb, players are required to kick the terminal in Azriel's very first room. That way, players are aware that they have this capacity, and can recall this ability again when they need to use it later.

&9 4/9: Azriel's first scene is meant to familiarize players with the environment of Barracus without them having to worry about getting barraged by too many puzzles. Letting the player explore this route now, rather than later, gives the player a more goal-oriented vision for the subsequent chase sequence with Matthius and a wider vision of the environment when they need to undergo their investigation.

&10 5/9: Looming landmarks provide a visual reinforcement for a player's goals. The Weather Tower here in the beginning establishes itself as a potential destination which the player may visit later.

&11 6/9: Dialog puzzles in a game early on prove tricky, as they are in a sense a series of correct versus wrong responses. As such, they have the potential to frustrate players with failure, and then cause them to quit the game before it even starts. A solution to that here is twofold.

&12 First, players can solve the puzzle multiple ways by referencing information they gathered earlier, or by bluffing by claiming to be with the Boryokudan. If each method fails, however, players then have the option to call Kane for help. In allowing the player to improvise early on, it lessens the chance that the player will become frustrated and lose incentive to keep playing.

&13 7/9: The 'sliding glass door puzzle' was an attempt to put a spin on the old 'locked door' situation by utilizing a couple of different mechanics. First, the player uses an inventory item, his stick, on the door. Then, the player kicks the stick in order to create a hole. Lastly, the player finally interacts with the hole to unlock the door and finally solve the puzzle.

&14 8/9: The hiding puzzle in Matthius' apartment used to have only one solution--hiding behind the door--although arbitrary it may have been. However, many players also attempted to hide outside on the fire escape. Rather than discouraging players by disallowing that, it was opted to implement the alternative solution to the puzzle in order to complement the player's logic.

&15 9/9: By the end of this introductory scene, I wanted to answer at least some of the questions presented to the player at the beginning of the scene. For one, who is this 'Matthius Howard,' and why didn't he show up for Azriel? This is at least partially answered by now, through the Boryokudan's reveal and the call with Matthius. Also, we get to see a bit more of Azriel's intentions in relation to his presence on Barracus in his search for his brother.

&23 1/7: This scene was originally the first time that players saw Delta-Six, as it also more properly introduced the Director as the teacher and warden of Delta-Six. However, introducing those two critical characters this late into the narrative made them seem almost tangential to the supposed main storyline of Azriel. This partially led to the current introduction of Delta-Six's memory wipe, in an effort to balance out the two story-lines and protagonists more evenly.

&24 2/7: The 'logic tests' spoken of by the Director were originally actual puzzles in the game. However, it later became apparent that the logic tests did not serve a useful purpose other than side-tracking the player from the critical weapon tutorial to what could have been some irksome logic puzzles.

&25 3/7: At the 2010 Independent Games Festival and E3 this was one of the main playable scenes. Player feedback often centered on the same issues, leading to a slight redesign of the combat tutorial. After the redesign, the head-shot zone color was changed from red to green, players could skip the tutorial text, and players could shoot rising targets, in addition to several other changes.

&26 4/7: Giselle's introduction is meant to create the idea for the player that you cannot be sure of whom you can trust in Center 7. Also, It sets up more mysteries for the player to solve: 'Who is this woman, what did she want on that cloth, and why did I have that cloth in the first place?'

&27 5/7: With the tutorials, I tried to embed them as much as possible into the narrative and game world. The gun tutorial does this, and here I tried to do it with the box tutorial. That way, it becomes more plausible to the player that they are learning something, and less intrusive by not snapping players out of the game by a formal tutorial sequence.

&28 6/7: Originally this scene had both Epsilon-Five and Balder in the room, presenting two alternative options of trust.  However, this appeared to make the narrative too confusing, too fast, by giving the player too much information in a short time span. Instead, it was opted to pan Balder's introduction into the next scene, letting Epsilon-Five's dialog sink in before contradicting it with Balder's.

&29 7/7: Early in the narrative structure, the game does not stick to one protagonist for too long. The first several scenes are relatively linear in their gameplay, in order to push the player forward through the story, without getting the player bogged down by too many puzzles. Only after the initial setup of the two protagonists and the establishment of the gameplay does the game pan out towards a more non-linear structure.

&30 1/5: The first battle with Azriel is arguably the most important one, because it sets the tone for the combat for the rest of the entire game. If players are too frustrated now, then it creates a recurrent problem. This one battle was redesigned several times until it finally became more comfortable for players to complete.

&31 2/5: Before Gemini Rue, I was briefly designing the concept for a science fiction game, part of which was centered around the idea of working with companion characters. The hope was that allowing the player to use NPCs as inventory items would add another facet to standard adventure gameplay.  However, as that game never got developed, I decided to incorporate that mechanic into Gemini Rue, which is first introduced here with Matthius.

&32 3/5: Rather than having a 'blind' chase sequence, I wanted the player to be familiar with his or her environment when leading Matthius to evacuation, thus reusing the introductory location. Practically, it also uses the same art assets, thus saving production time.

&33 4/5: This short sequence uses what may be termed as the 'Stormtrooper Exchange:' alert the player of unseen enemies well in advance by having those enemies engage in idle banter.

&34 5/5: The final puzzle of this sequence requires players to recall two abilities they used in the past: using NPCs as a companion character, and the 'kick' verb. This attempts to create a satisfying resolution to the mechanics that players learned at the beginning of prior scenes.

&36 1/8: Switching characters, although now a somewhat integral part of the game, was originally not in the design. This feature was added as a solution to provide non-linear gameplay for the player, meaning that whenever players get stuck on a certain puzzle, they would not have to frustratingly linger on that puzzle.

&37 With non-linear gameplay, players are instead presented with alternative puzzles to solve, in this case, via the other protagonist, Azriel. The additional puzzles provide another means for the user to continue playing without having to wait to solve one specific puzzle before continuing.

&38 2/8: A simple way to imply the progression of time in Center 7 is by removing the other cafeteria inhabitants after your meal. This simple graphical change possesses a bit of narrative power, even through just one visual frame.

&39 3/8: Setting Delta-Six as a test subject in the confines of Center 7 is practically convenient in terms of gameplay, as it allows the player to continue to be trained within the context of the world and the story. That way, each new tutorial can be embedded into the game as much as possible.

&40 4/8: Incidentally, putting each of the respective characters of Balder, Epsilon-Five, and Giselle in different sections of Center 7 provides an incentive for players to then explore the environment of Center 7. It also provides a context in which to fit each of the character's personalities and their motives.

&41 5/8: The random notes scattered throughout Center 7 are meant to function parallel to the extra ammo in Azriel's adjacent scene. They are a small, optional, and in this case narrative reward for players to seek out, aside from the main quest.

&42 6/8: The high angle of Center 7's room design serves two purposes. Functionally, it allows a large amount of character roaming without the need for scaling. In terms of atmosphere, the high angle enhances the idea that someone is always looking down on the player, watching them, observing his or her every move.

&43 7/8: The drain puzzle involves an increasingly complex series of problems all layered on top of the original problem. First, players must open the original drain by figuring out which drain the gun is lodged in. Then, they must use Balder's help to unlodge the next drain. After that, players must use Epsilon-Five's help to gain access to another drain. Finally, players must coordinate with Giselle to finally unlodge the last drain and obtain the pistol.

&44 8/8: Logic puzzles in adventure games can be tricky to include. Some players may love them, and solve them almost immediately, while others will loathe them, or get stuck on them for dozens of minutes on end. When adding this puzzle, it was important to keep it in the non-linear structure of the two scenes, so if players could not immediately solve it, they could always come back later to finish it.

&49 1/9: In creating a full-length adventure game, the number of art assets can quickly get out of control. In order to minimize this problem, the player returns to Barracus for three scenes in the game: the introduction, the shootout, and the investigation. Likewise, Delta-Six has all of his scenes contained in the one location of Center 7.

&52 4/9: The rain particle effects in the game are composed of three main elements: The first is an overlay of individual sprites falling that make up the rain drops; the second is a series of independent dripping animations that animate separately from each other; the third is a random scattering of white, transparent pixels on any surface areas that make up the room.

&53 5/9: This scene uses a sliding trick whose benefits are twofold. Instead of creating a new walk cycle for the character of 'Kenneth,' the screen instead just pans to the left when he appears, saving time on production costs. Conceptually, this also works to surprise the player with the gun during the camera pan, rather than have Kenneth walk on screen.

&54 6/9: The character of 'Sayuri' has one of the most crucial roles in the game, as she bridges the gap between the story lines of Azriel and Delta-Six. Originally, her identity as the escaped prisoner of Center 7 was revealed here, but it was decided to change that and reveal her dual identity later during a moment of action and confusion in the Weather Tower, adding more narrative weight to that scene.

&55 7/9: One of the influences for Gemini Rue is the film, Blade Runner, and the photo analysis puzzle is one instance that draws direct inspiration from it, specifically, the Esper analysis sequence.

&56 Before its current state, this puzzle had the player navigating a series of drop-down menus in order to make some logical inferences about the identity of the pilot. However, that design was too confusing and not inherently very fun, and so was dropped in favor of a simpler, more atmospheric, and nostalgic approach.

&57 8/9: In terms of puzzle design, this entire sequence with Azriel works in three main branches which converge at this instance. First, players must find Sayuri's ID card to eventually fix the lock pick. Second, players must follow a series of references to get the Juice withdrawal cure. Lastly, players must infiltrate the Boryokudan and track down Kenneth's leads to reach this apartment.

&100 9/9: In terms of structure, Gemini Rue was designed to have a sort of double funnel approach. At the beginning, the gameplay is mostly linear in order to propel players along the narrative so that they may become interested in the game world. Towards the middle, the game opens up to be more non-linear, allowing players to explore this world now that they have a foothold in it.

&73 2/3: This scene gets into a bit more of the Center 7 mythos by inferring the idea of the constant barrage of attack on the center from the outside world, which result from miscellaneous particles hitting the asteroid in the nebula. Furthermore, having Delta-Six do the repairs raises the question of why aren't there more engineers left in the station?

&74 3/3: Stopping Balder is a two-fold puzzle: first players must figure out they need to catch him in the stream of steam in order to take him down, but in order to do that he must be immobile. After players figure out that Balder stops whenever they talk with him, then the final piece comes into place.

&76 2/5: The puzzles in the Weather Tower are designed to show players the problems before the solutions. The first thing that players see when they enter is the broken conveyor belt. Upon going up the ladder to turn the power back on, players realize that the circuit is disconnected. Then, players must figure out how to get up to connect the circuit at the empty conduit. All of this is to exercise the player's mind before giving them the solution.

&77 3/5: This room presents a visual design challenge, as it contains three different areas of gameplay importance: the switch machine, the empty conduit, and the movable box. In order to differentiate between the zones, the room is dimly lit, setting the main light sources on the important gameplay areas. In addition, the conduit light flickers and the box light uses a particle animation, drawing further attention to these two important areas.

&78 4/5: Visually, this scene posed the problem of how could you convey to the player that a specific group of crates possessed the juice that they were looking for? The solution came in the form of a visual trail that would lead the player to the specific crates in question.

&82 2/4: The notes found throughout Center 7 were originally designed to be written from the vantage point of Delta-Six, as a series of memoirs on who to trust and what to do once he regained his memory. However, this design would have put three different narrative takes into the story: Delta-Six's, Epsilon-Five's, and Balder's. By restricting it to only two threads, the player's relationship is more focused between Epsilon-Five and Balder, instead of a self-reflective one.

&83 3/4: This little sequence, although cliched it may be, was added to provide a bit of intermediary pacing before the ensuing gun battle. I wanted players to feel a sense of progression and desperation in the escape, not just immediate action.

&84 4/4: Showing this escape sequence with both Delta-Six and Epsilon-Five gives players a renewed view of the Center when they return later with Azriel and Sayuri. In addition, players can then infer what happened in the time in between the two narratives by the changes in the environment.

Each one that is crossed out with a red X is one less assassin who is no longer trailing him.

&92 2/2: Creating the final puzzle in an adventure game can be a tricky process. On the one hand, you want to create a build up in difficulty so that the final puzzle can justify the story's resolution. On the other hand, you don't want to frustrate players too much right as the story is about to come to a close.

&921 The compromise I ended up with was a simple reactor puzzle which required an inventory item (the gas mask), which then led to a short dialog tree of various options. This framed the puzzle in a slightly more complex, although still completable manner for the player to solve.
