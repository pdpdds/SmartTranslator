 Many problems in the city can be solved with the persuasive arts, and to good effect. However, sometimes situations may require a more violent approach to get what you want. Just as with any other item, weapons are equipped with left-click and holstered with right-click. Different weapons are better for different jobs, but if you're using a firearm, be sure to keep an eye on your ammo.
 Many problems in the city can be solved with the persuasive arts, and to good effect. However, sometimes situations may require a more violent approach to get what you want. Just as with any other item, weapons are equipped with left-click and holstered with right-click. Different weapons are better for different jobs, but if you're using a firearm, be sure to keep an eye on your ammo.
 The inventory at the top of the screen is where all of your items are stored. A left click equips an item to be used, and a right click examines it. The inventory drop down also shows your health and toxicity levels. Health dictates how much damage you can sustain, and toxicity decides how many drugs you can consume before overdosing, damaging yourself. If your health reaches zero, you will perish.
화면 상단의 인벤토리는 모든 아이템이 저장되는 곳입니다. 왼쪽 클릭은 사용할 아이템을 준비하고 오른쪽 클릭은 항목을 조사합니다. 인벤토리 드롭다운에는 당신의 건강 및 유독성 수준도 보여줍니다. 건강은 당신이 얼마나 오래 살 수 있는지를 결정하고, 독성은 당신이 과다복용하기 전에 얼마나 많은 약을 먹을 수 있는지를 결정하며, 당신에게 대미지를 줍니다. 만약 당신의 건강이 제로에 도달한다면, 당신은 죽을 것입니다.
