So the old Emir is still alive? I am very relieved to hear that, Effendi. I hope he will walk the streets of this city as a human again soon.

That is most distressing news. I had hoped that my kin would be safe within Shapeir's walls. Who knows what evil may befall Shapeir in your absence.

The new owner of the inn is as corrupt as the government. Men like him will be happy to sit by and watch this city decay as long as their own interests are served.

I wish Khaveen would fill his dungeon with more of Ferrari's seedy associates and less innocent people.

Shema and Shameen are good folk. It seems they went through a lot to bring you here. I hope to see them again when this is all over, so I can listen to their tales and watch my cousin dance.

Khaveen's ruthlessness and skill with the sword ensure that even his own men are afraid of him. That is how he established and maintained his grasp on Raseir. Through intimidation and oppression.

Yet, rumor has it that he is taking orders from someone behind the scenes. I personally find it hard to imagine anyone with the capability of intimidating Khaveen.

I would love to hear more, Hero, but now is not the time for tales.

The guards should have noticed our escape by now and will be searching the streets soon. We should not stay here too long.

Thank you, Effendi. They spare very little water on prisoners these days. I shall not forget this act of kindness.

The magic of the pin hides it from the sight of enemies, which is why the guards did not take it away from you.

Bad idea. If you yell down the passageway, you might alert the guards to the fact that you have escaped from your cell.
