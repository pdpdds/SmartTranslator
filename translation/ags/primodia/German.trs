To begin with, you[cannot die in[Primordia or become[permanently stuck.[Your mistakes do[have consequences,[but these enrich[the game with[different paths[and endings.
"우선, 프라이모디아에서는 죽거나 진행이 막히는 일이 없습니다. 실수로 인해 어떤 결과가 야기될 수는 있지만, 이는 다른 사건과 결말로 이어집니다."
You can play the[game using only the[mouse. Point the[cursor and left click[for Horatio to walk[to a location. If[there is something[to interact with,[a label will appear[beside the cursor.
이 게임은 마우스만을 사용하여 플레이할 수 있습니다. 좌클릭으로 호라시오를 이동시킬 수 있으며, 상호작용할 수 있는 물건 위에 커서를 놓으면 이름이 표시될 것입니다.
If you left click[on an interaction[point, or \"hotspot,\"[Horatio will pick[up an item, use a[device, or talk to[another robot. If[you right click, he[will examine the[hotspot.
만약 이 상호작용 가능한 지점을 좌클릭하면, 호라시오는 물건을 집어들거나, 장치를 사용하거나, 다른 로봇에게 말을 걸 것입니다. 우클릭하면, 그는 그 지점을 조사할 것입니다.
Sometimes, when you[click on a hotspot,[a zoomed-in view[will appear. Here[too, left and right[click function the[same way. If you[click outside the[view, or hit escape,[the view will close.
때로 조사 지점을 클릭하면, 확대된 화면을 보여주는 창이 나올 것입니다. 이 화면에서도 좌우 클릭은 똑같은 기능을 합니다. 만약 창 바깥을 클릭하거나, 나가기를 누른다면, 창은 닫힐 것입니다.
If you left click[on Crispin, he will[give you a hint, so[long as you haven't[bugged him recently.[He will also auto-[matically hint if[you have been stuck[for a while.
크리스핀을 클릭하면, 그는 종종 힌트를 줄 것입니다. 또한 게임 진행이 막혔을 경우에도 자동으로 힌트를 줍니다.
If you move the[cursor to the top of[the screen, a toolbar[will appear. Here,[you can select[Crispin. Once you[do so, you can direct[him to interact with[hotspots by clicking[on them.
커서를 화면 상단으로 가져가면, 툴바가 나타납니다. 툴바에서 크리스핀을 선택한 후, 조사할 지점을 클릭하여 상호작용 하도록 할 수 있습니다.
You can also view[inventory from the[toolbar. Here, you[can select items by[left clicking or[examine them by right[clicking. Close the[inventory by clicking[OK or outside it,[or pressing escape.
또한 툴바에서 소지품 창을 열 수 있습니다. 클릭하여 아이템을 선택하거나, 좌클릭하여 살펴볼 수 있습니다. OK를 누르거나 창 밖을 클릭하여 소지품 창을 닫을 수 있습니다.
While in the[inventory screen,[you can use items[on each other by[selecting one and[left clicking on[another. This will[combine them, or[use a tool as[necessary.

&658 I don't remember ever meeting you. I'm Horatio Nullbuilt, version five.
&658 제겐 당신을 만난 기억이 없습니다. 제 이름은 호라시오 널빌트, 버전 5입니다.
&100 Ahh. Five is a righteous number, holy before Man, for five were the Primordial stewards, built by Man to safeguard the last, lost city of Metropol.
&100 "아하. 다섯은 인간 앞에서 신성하고도 온전한 숫자지. 지금은 쇠락한 최후의 도시, 메트로폴을 수호하도록 태고로부터 지음받았던 종들의 수 역시 다섯이었다네."
&101 But I met thy first version and thy third.
&101 허나 나는 그대의 첫 버전과 세 번째 버전을 만났었네.
&102 Thou camest in thy infancy, in wroth confusion, denouncing the shrine as a weapon once turned against thee.
&102 "아직 미성숙하고 혼란하여, 깨우치지 못했던 때에 왔던 그대는 성전을 일컬어 그대를 공격했던 병기라 매도했었지."
&103 Later, thou returnedst, penitent, and I taught thee the mysteries of Humanism.
&103 "이후, 그대는 참회하며 내게로 돌아왔고, 나는 기꺼이 그대에게 휴머니즘의 신비를 가르쳤다네."
&104 Yet, though memory be fleeting, faith endureth.
&104 메모리는 지워졌을지 모르나, 신앙심은 남는 것이지.
&105 That \"thing\"?
&105 "저것"이라니?
&106 O, defile not thy tongue, wanderer.
&106 오, 망령된 말을 지껄이지 말게, 방랑자여.
&107 Yon shrine is a relic of the Primordium, ancient and glorious.
&107 저 성전은 영광된 태고의 시대를 기리는 유물이라네.
&108 Imbued with Man's power, it changed the very sand to crystal.
&108 인간께서 부여하신 권능으로, 한낱 모래를 크리스탈로 변화시키는 기적을 일으켰지.
&129 (Did he just say \"power\"?)
&129 (방금 그거 "동력" 얘기한 거 맞죠?)
&662 (Yes, yes he did.)
&662 (그래, 맞아.)
&663 I'm looking for a power source, and I detected one here.
&663 저는 동력원을 찾는 중인데, 여기에서 하나를 발견했습니다.
&664 Can you help?
&664 도와주실 수 없을까요?
&665 This is a matter of life and death.
&665 생사가 걸린 시급한 문제입니다.
&109 *Power* is not mine to bestow, wanderer.
&109 *권능*을 내리는 것은 나의 능력 밖의 일일세, 방랑자여.
&16 It is the gift of Man, yea, the very spark of life in our iron shells.
&16 "그것은 인간이 우리에게 내리신 은총 그 자체이자, 우리의 철제 껍데기 속에 피어나는 생명의 불꽃이라네."
&110 Who am I to usurp that sacred power?
&110 내가 무엇이관대 감히 그처럼 신성한 권능을 마음대로 하겠는가?
&666 I'm not sure I was clear. . . .
&666 제가 정확히 말씀을 드렸는지...
&111 Nay, thou wert clear, wanderer, but thy question leads only to darkness.
&111 "아닐세, 방랑자여. 그대의 말하고자 하는 바는 명확하였네. 다만 그 질문은 그대를 흑암 속으로 인도할 뿐이니."
&19 Ask another.
&19 다른 이를 찾아보게나.
&668 Have you seen it?
&668 혹시 보지 못하셨습니까?
&669 It stole something of mine.
&669 놈이 제 물건을 훔쳐갔습니다.
&20 Indeed, the very thing passed this way scarce hours ago.
&20 보았고말고. 그대가 말한 그대로 생긴 로봇이 불과 몇 시간 전 이 곳을 지나갔다네.
&21 With a gentle hand I bestowed a gift upon the heathen, a relic from yon shrine.
&21 나는 그 이단자에게 기꺼이 성전의 유물을 내어주었지.
&22 So tamed, it hied hence unto the waste.
&22 그러자 그는, 지체않고 곧장 황무지로 향하더군.
&670 Really? Where did it go?
&670 정말요? 어디로 가던가요?
&23 I followed the thing for many miles, exhorting it to follow the path of righteousness.
&23 나는 그 자를 올바른 길로 인도하기 위하여 수 마일을 쫓아갔었네.
&24 But I fear it was unready for enlightenment, for it struck me down with a beam of energy.
&24 "허나 그는 깨우칠 준비가 되지 않았던 탓인지, 나를 에너지 빔으로 쳐서 땅에 쓰러뜨리고 말았네."
&130 *That* sounds familiar.
&130 *그 얘긴* 어디선가 많이 들어본 것 같네요.
&671 Do you know where it was heading?
&671 놈이 어디로 향했는지 아십니까?
&25 Indeed, wanderer.
&25 알고말고, 방랑자여.
&26 Its way was clear: it sought to return to the den of iniquity that once, in mine own youth, I fled.
&26 "그 자가 향하는 곳은 명확했네: 먼 옛날 내가 도망쳐나왔던, 그 죄악의 소굴로 다시 돌아가는 길이었지."
&672 And . . . where is that?
&672 그건... 어디에 있습니까?
&27 Set thy path in the seventy-third degree and thou shalt find it.
&27 그대의 경로를 75도 방향으로 설정하고 따라가면 찾게 될 것이네.
&28 Thy destination is a dome arising from the waste.
&28 황무지 가운데 서 있는 돔이 그대의 목적지일세.
&29 Go. But keep with thee the Word of Man, lest wickedness lead thee astray.
&29 "이제 떠나게. 그러나 인간의 말씀을 가슴 속에 간직하고, 사악한 이들이 그대를 미혹시키지 못하도록 지키게."
&30 So I taught thee, wanderer.
&30 내가 그대를 이 길로 이끌었었지, 방랑자여.
&31 If thou hast kept the faith, then unto this shrine thou mayst pay devotion.
&31 만일 그대가 신앙을 간직하고 있다면, 그대에게는 저 성전에 경배를 올릴 충분한 자격이 있네.
&32 But this is a relic for the *adept*, not the neophyte, wanderer.
&32 "그러나 이 유물은 *신실한 자들*을 위한 것이지, 믿음이 약한 이들을 위한 것이 아닐세, 방랑자여."
&33 And I must know that thou hast not fallen into darkness and heresy.
&33 "하여 나는 그대가 무지와 불신앙의 길로 들어선 것은 아닌지 확인해보아야만 하겠네."
&18 Answer me these questions three, that I may know that thou art faithful still.
&18 질문 세 개에 답하게나. 이를 통해 그대의 신앙심이 여전히 깊은지 알 수 있을걸세.
&35 Why are we here?
&35 우리는 왜 존재하는가?
&675 I found the dome you described, but it is closed up.
&675 말씀해주신 돔에 가봤습니다만, 닫혀 있더군요.
&676 Do you know how to get in?
&676 어떻게 들어갈 수 있는지 아십니까?
&36 Nay, wanderer, for never did I plan to return down that dark path.
&36 모르네, 방랑자여. 왜냐하면 나는 그 타락의 길로 다시 돌아가려 한 적이 없었기 때문일세.
&683 Here it is, Ever-Faithful. Your old gospel. I have studied it many times.
&683 "에버-페이스풀, 당신이 주셨던 복음서를 가져왔습니다. 항상 제 가까이 두고 말씀을 묵상해왔었지요."
&70 Then thou art worthy of the shrine, and of my gift to thee.
&70 그렇다면 그대는 성전에 나아가 경배하고, 그대에게 주었던 선물을 가질 합당한 자격이 있네.
&71 Keep the gift, and approach, if thou wilt.
&71 책은 간직하도록 하게. 그리고 성전으로 가 보게나.
&684 I don't have it.
&684 지금은 가지고 있지 않습니다.
&72 The disciple must keep with him the Word, always.
&72 제자라면 마땅히 말씀을 지니고 다녀야 한다네, 언제나 말일세.
&73 Return with it, that I may judge thee worthy.
&73 책을 가지고 돌아오게, 그리하면 다시 그대의 자격을 판단하겠네.
&37 Fare thee well, wanderer. I shall meet thee hence.
&37 잘 가게, 방랑자여. 다시 보게 되기를 바라네.
&131 Frankly, that was ridiculous.
&131 아주 기가 막힌 대화였네요.
&678 Something must be wrong with his language processing unit.
&678 그의 언어 회로에 뭔가 문제가 있는 게 분명해.
&132 That's the *least* of his problems, boss.
&132 그건 수많은 문제들 중 *가장 사소한* 거라구요, 보스.
&133 A shrine?! That thing's a giant bomb!
&133 성전이라니?! 저건 그냥 커다란 폭탄이잖아요!
&134 And I thought *you* were crazy about that Humanist stuff.
&134 *보스보다* 훨씬 더 휴머니스트 어쩌구에 미쳐 있는 로봇을 보게 되리라곤 상상도 못했었는데.
&38 Fare thee well, wanderer.
&38 잘 가게, 방랑자여. 다시 보게 되기를 바라네.
&1984 To learn wisdom.
&1984 지혜를 깨닫기 위해서입니다.
&39 Wisdom thou must learn, wanderer, before thou shalt be worthy of this shrine.
&39 "반드시 깨우쳐야만 하고말고, 방랑자여. 그대가 이 성전에 합당한 이임을 증명하기 위해서라도 말일세."
&1985 To revere Man.
&1985 인간을 섬기기 위해서입니다.
&40 If thou wouldst revere Man, wanderer, thou must study his Word and know it well.
&40 "만일 그대가 인간을 섬기고자 한다면, 방랑자여, 우선은 그분의 말씀을 마음 깊이 새겨야 할 것일세."
&1986 Because Man created us.
&1986 인간이 우리를 창조하셨기 때문입니다.
&41 Indeed.
&41 참으로 옳은 말이로다.
&1987 To wonder at Man's works.
&1987 인간의 지으신 바를 보고 경탄하기 위해서입니다.
&42 Wonder, wanderer, why thou canst not learn from the All-Builder's greatest work, his Word, which I bestowed upon thee that thou wouldst know him.
&42 "방랑자여, 무엇보다 놀라운 것은 그대가 그 모든 가르침에도 불구하고 모든 것의 창조자이신 그 분의 위대한 솜씨, 그리고 말씀을 잊었다는 사실이라네."
&80 I don't know.
&80 모르겠습니다.
&43 Then thou art not worthy of this shrine.
&43 그렇다면 그대는 이 성전으로 나아갈 자격이 없네.
&112 What is Man?
&112 인간이란 무엇인가?
&1988 God.
&1988 신입니다.
&44 \"God\" is a word, but no answer.
&44 "신"이란 건 단어에 불과하지, 해답은 아닐세.
&1989 A perfect machine.
&1989 완벽한 기계입니다.
&45 Thou answerest simply, but the simplest answer may be the truest, and here thou speakest truly.
&45 그대의 답은 단순하네, 허나 단순한 답이 진실일 때도 있지. 그리고 그대는 진실을 말하고 있네.
&1990 The First Builder.
&1990 최초의 창조자입니다.
&46 Nay, but he is not the first builder, for first he spake, and spake the Word, and 'twas the Word that built the Code.
&46 틀렸네, 최초에 말씀하신 것은 그분이었으나, 코드를 지어내기 시작한 것은 말씀이었으니 말일세. 
&1991 Our Lord and Master.
&1991 우리의 구주이자 주인이십니다.
&47 Verily, to Man we owe all fealty, but no more do we define him than do shadows define the sun.
&47 진실로 이르노니, 우리는 인간을 전적으로 믿고 따라야 하네. 그러나 그 답은 마치 그림자로 태양의 존재를 인식하는 것과 마찬가지일세.
&48 Nay, wanderer, we are but a fraction of his great scope.
&48 "자네의 답은 틀렸네, 방랑자여. 우리는 우리 자신을 통해 그 분을 규정하기엔 너무나 보잘것 없는 존재들일세."
&50 So, thou hast studied the catechism.
&50 보아하니, 그대는 교리를 마음 깊이 새기고 있었던 모양이군.
&51 I shall question thee on that matter no more.
&51 내 더 이상은 묻지 않겠네.
&52 But tell me, wanderer, dost thou know thyself? Who art *thou*?
&52 허나 말해보게, 방랑자여, 그대는 그대 자신을 아는가? *그대*는 누구인가?
&94 Who art thou?
&94 그대는 누구인가?
&722 Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.
&722 호라시오 널빌트, 버전 5입니다.
&53 Nay, wanderer, but thou art not.
&53 틀렸네, 방랑자여. 그건 답이 아닐세.
&54 Though thou callest the sun the moon, yet still it is the sun.
&54 그대가 태양을 달이라 부른다한들, 태양은 여전히 태양이라네.
&55 "Horatio" is the name thou wearest, but it is not thee.
&55 "호라시오"는 그대가 스스로 일컫는 이름일 뿐, 진정한 자네의 이름이 아닐세. 
&56 Know thyself, then return.
&56 그대 자신을 알게 되었을 때, 돌아오게나.
&1992 One of Man's works.
&1992 인간의 피조물 중 하나입니다.
&57 Thou speakest truly, wanderer, but incompletely, for if thou wert naught but \"one of Man's works,\" then what difference betwixt thee and junkyard scrap?
&57 "그대의 답은 진실이네만, 방랑자여, 불완전한 답이라네. 만약 자네가 ""인간의 피조물 중 하나""일 뿐 아무 것도 아니라면, 그대와 저 고철들 사이엔 대체 어떤 차이점이 있단 말인가?"
&1993 A free robot.
&1993 자유의지를 가진 로봇입니다.
&59 Aye, wanderer, free thou art, for Man created thee free to revere him.
&59 "그대는 참으로 자유로운 존재일세, 방랑자여. 그 자유의지로 인간을 섬기도록 그분께 지음받은 존재이지 않나."
&60 But many are free and yet are not thee.
&60 그러나 자유로운 모든 존재들이 그대와 같은 존재인 것은 아닐세.
&1994 I am what I am.
&1994 저는 제 자신일 따름입니다.
&62 An elliptic answer, wanderer, and untrue.
&62 방랑자여, 그것은 불완전한 답일 뿐만 아니라, 참이 아닐세.
&63 Man alone is his own essence; *thy* essence comes from Man.
&63 인간만이 자신의 본질 그 자체이시지; *그대의* 본질은 인간으로부터 온 것이라네.
&679 Horus.
&679 호루스.
&680 My name . . . is Horus.
&680 제 이름은... 호루스입니다.
&65 Three of thy versions I have met, wanderer, and thou art the first to know that name which is thine.
&65 "지금껏 세 버전의 그대를 만났네만, 방랑자여, 그대의 참된 이름을 알고 있었던 것은 그대가 처음이라네. "
&681 But . . . if none of *them* used the name Horus, what makes you think that's *my* name?
&681 "하지만... 만약 *그들* 중 누구도 호루스란 이름을 쓰지 않았다면, 당신은 어떻게 그것이 *제* 이름이란 걸 아셨습니까?"
&66 In my very body, in mine eyes, when I behold thee, upon thy image are these words inscribed:
&66 "내 이 눈으로, 직접 그대를 바라볼 때마다, 그대의 모습 위에 이 문장이 떠올랐네. "
&67 \"FRIEND: HORUS.\"
&67 "친구: 호루스."
&68 Thou hast answered my questions.
&68 그대는 지금까지 나의 질문에 잘 답해주었네.
&69 But still, I shall not let thee pass unless thou bearest in thy hands the Gospel that I bestowed upon thee.
&69 "허나 내가 이전에 그대에게 주었던 복음서를 가지고 오기 전에는 이 곳을 통과하게 해 줄 수 없다네."

&74 With what duty did Man charge us?
&74 인간이 우리에게 내려주신 소명은 무엇인가?
&75 Yea, brother, for it is written that Man said unto the machines, \"Keep this world, tend it, and make it flourish.\"
&75 옳은 말일세, 형제여. 인간께서 로봇들에게 말씀하시길, "이 세계를 너희에게 주노니, 잘 보살펴 번성케 하라."고 하셨었으니 말일세.
&76 That, then, is our first and foremost charge.
&76 그러므로, 그것이야말로 우리의 가장 우선되며 중요한 소명인 셈이지.
&77 Nay, no such burden did Man lay upon us. That is the compulsion of Logic, yea, Logic and Memory. But it is a compulsion that arises from within.
&77 "아닐세, 인간께서는 우리에게 그와 같은 짐을 지우신 적이 없네. 그것은 다만 논리회로, 그리고 메모리로부터 나오는 충동과도 같은 것, 즉 우리의 내면이 우리 자신에게 강제하는 바이지."
&79 Thou speakest heresy, wanderer.
&79 그대의 주장하는 바는 이단일세, 방랑자여.
&80 Know that it is written that \"we are lesser machines, built by those built by Man.\"
&80 그대 역시 "우리는 인간이 지으신 기계들에 의해 지음받은, 덜 완전한 기계들이다."라는 말씀을 알고 있을걸세.
&81 Who, then, are we to build in Man's image, who build but poor reflections of ourselves?
&81 "그렇다면 우리 자신의 형상조차 불완전하게 재현하는 우리가, 대체 무슨 권리와 능력으로 인간의 형상을 따라 기계를 만든단 말인가?"

&25 Big ol' Factor built just about everything from down in the Underworks,
&25 덩치 큰 팩터는 언더워크에 터를 잡고 그야말로 모든 걸 제조해왔어.
&26 an', well, there was another one, I think.
&26 그리고 어, 하나 더 있었는데, 분명히.
&27 Don't even remember his name.
&27 이름이 뭐였는지 기억이 통 안 나는군.
&28 An' MetroMind, of course.

&29 She used ta run the trains. But now she's got the whole show.
&29 이전까지는 기차를 운행하는 역할을 맡았었지만, 지금은 모든 걸 도맡아 관리하고 있어.
&728 Where can I find her?
&728 어디에 가야 만날 수 있습니까?
&30 Like I said, tyro, she *is* the City, so you've found 'er already.
&30 내가 이미 말했듯, 그는 도시 *그 자체*야. 즉 넌 이미 그를 만났다고.
&31 Probably hocked yerself to her just ta get here.

&34 만약 규칙을 읽었다면, 메트로마인드가 그런 미신을 별로 좋게 보지 않는다는 걸 알게 될 거야.
&35 Under the Refuge Rule, you've got two days ta talk about make-believe Man all ya want.
&35 난민 특별법에 의해, 이틀동안은 자네가 인간의 존재같은 거짓을 떠들고 다녀도 아무 문제가 없어.
&36 But actual *writin'* about Man?
&36 하지만 실제 인간에 대해 쓴 *서적*이라면?
&37 That gets tossed ta the Underworks with the rest a' the trash an' trouble.
&37 다른 골칫덩이들과 함께 언더워크로 내던져지게 될 수밖에 없지.
&731 How can I get it back?
&731 되찾을 방법은 없습니까?
&38 Ha! Yer risk-inhibitor flakin' on ya, tyro?
&38 위험감지 센서가 고장나기라도 한 거야, 풋내기?
&39 You'd have ta do some diggin' down in the Underworks, which ain't exactly easy.
&39 우선 자넨 언더워크로 내려갈 방법을 찾아야 할거야. 그리고 그건 그리 쉬운 일은 아닐테지.
&40 Then, even if ya find it, you'll just be stickin' yer finger in MetroMind's socket.
&40 그리고, 만약 그걸 찾아낸다 해도, 그건 메트로마인드에게 날 좀 잡아가라고 광고하는 꼴이나 마찬가지야.
&41 Like I said: she's got no time for heretics, lunatics, an' the like.
&41 아까도 말했지만: 그는 광신도나, 미친 놈들에게 온정을 베풀 정도로 한가하진 않거든.
&646 How about quick-witted levitators?
&646 하지만 재치있는 공중부양 로봇이라면 어떨까요?
&42 Don't think she cares for them either.
&42 그런 이들에게도 별 신경 안쓸 것 같은데.
&733 It was stolen from my ship, the UNNIIC, and I think it's being kept in that tower over there.
&733 제 함선인 UNNIIC에 있던 것인데 도둑맞았고, 지금은 저 쪽에 있는 탑 안에 있는 것으로 추정됩니다.
&43 The "Great Tower," ya mean.
&43 "그레이트 타워" 말이군.
&45 Sure, it's probably in there. Long with all the other generators an' reactors an' cores that keep the lights on.
&45 뭐, 거기 있을 수도 있어. 다른 발전기며 반응로, 코어와 함께 도시가 굴러가게 만들고 있겠지. 
&46 If MetroMind took it, ya don't, tyro.
&46 만약 정말 메트로마인드가 그걸 가져갔다면, 그걸로 끝이라구, 풋내기.
&47 Her word is law.
&47 그의 말이 곧 법이니까.
&48 Arbiter's the only one who ever coulda said otherwise, an' he's been gone a long time.
&48 아비터라면 그 말에 반론을 제기할 수도 있겠지만, 그가 모습을 보이지 않은 지도 꽤 오래 되었지.
&49 Get into the courthouse, maybe you could plead yer case.
&49 법원으로 한번 가 보라구, 어쩌면 이 일에 대해 청원할 수 있을지도 모르지.
&50 After half a dozen other folks took their turns, that is.
&50 물론 대여섯 기 남짓한 다른 로봇들 뒤에 줄부터 서야겠지만 말야.
&51 But ya can't; the old judge locked it up tight.
&51 그치만 사실은 택도 없는 일이지. 늙은 판사양반은 문을 걸어잠근지 오래니까.
&52 And who's ta say you'll win, eh?
&52 그리고 청원한다 쳐도, 자네가 이길 가능성이 있긴 할 것같나, 응?
&53 My advice?
&53 내 조언 하나 하지.
&735 I don't want your advice.
&735 당신 조언같은 건 필요 없습니다.
&736 I want my power core.
&736 전 파워 코어를 되찾고 싶을 뿐이니까요.
&54 Heh. Well then, good luck ta ya.
&54 허. 정 그렇다면야, 행운을 비네.
&738 Have you seen it?
&738 보신 적 있으십니까?
&739 It stole something of mine.
&739 놈이 제 물건을 훔쳐갔습니다.
&55 Sounds like Scraper to me.
&55 그거 왠지 스크래퍼같은데.
&740 Scraper?
&740 스크래퍼?
&56 Worked fer MetroMind even before she ran the show.
&56 메트로마인드가 이 곳의 실세가 되기 전부터 그와 함께 일해온 로봇이지.
&57 He was the one that blasted out the train tunnels under the city.
&57 도시 밑의 터널을 날려버린 장본인이기도 하고.
&741 Where can I find him?
&741 그는 어디에 있죠?
&58 Now how would I know that?
&58 그걸 내가 대체 어떻게 알겠어?
&59 That one goes where he wants.
&59 놈은 자기 멋대로 돌아다닌다고.
&60 Maybe the Great Tower. Maybe the tunnels. Who knows?
&60 어쩌면 그레이트 타워에 있을지도 모르지. 아니면 터널이나. 누가 알겠어?
&61 But I wouldn't go pickin' trouble with him, tyro.
&61 하지만 만일 내가 자네라면, 그에게 시비를 걸진 않을거야, 풋내기.
&62 Those lasers Scraper used fer cuttin' granite can slice up that tin shell yer wearin' like nothin'.
&62 스크래퍼가 화강암을 자를 때 쓰던 그 레이저라면 자네의 그 얄팍한 외피를 손쉽게 갈라버릴테니까.
&647 Hear, hear!
&647 거 봐요!
&742 I'll keep that in mind.
&742 그 말 명심하도록 하겠습니다.
&743 How do I get into the tower?
&743 타워 안에 들어갈 방법은 없습니까?
&63 You don't. Council members only.
&63 의회 멤버들이 아니면 안엔 못 들어가네.
&64 An' the only ones still clickin' are MetroMind an' Arbiter.
&64 그리고 그들 중 아직 작동중인 로봇은 메트로마인드와 아비터 뿐이지.
&65 An' lemme tell ya, neither a' them is one fer bendin' the rules.
&65 하지만 말일세, 둘 중 누구도 규칙을 어기게 용납할 양반들은 아니지.
&745 He called himself Leobuilt.
&745 그는 자기 자신을 레오빌트라고 소개했습니다.
&66 I'm a peddler, tyro, not a builder.
&66 이봐 풋내기, 난 행상인이지, 창조자가 아니라구.
&67 Like I said, a bunch a' Primordial machines:
&67 내가 말했던것처럼, 원시 기계 집단이라구
&68 A whole mess a' junkyards, canals, factories, smelters . . .
&68 거긴 완전 난장판이지. 쓰레기장에, 지하수로, 공장이며, 용광로까지...
&69 B'sod, *every* kinda heavy machinery.
&69 빌어먹을 *온갖* 종류의 기계들이 있어.
&70 All beneath the streets.
&70 그것도 바로 이 도시 아래에.
&71 Ol' Factor ran the place. Built just about everythin' in Metropol down there.
&71 늙은 팩터 양반이 거길 관리했었지. 그 밑에서 메트로폴의 거의 모든 것들을 만들어냈었어.
&748 "Ran" the place? Who's in charge now?
&748 관리"했었"다구요? 지금은 누가 관리합니까?
&72 Nobody. Not since MetroMind pulled the plug on Factor.
&72 아무도 안 해. 메트로마인드가 팩터의 전원을 끊어버린 이후로는 말이지.
&73 Whole place is full a' junk, an' full a' trouble.
&73 이젠 온통 고물과 말썽거리 외엔 찾아볼 수 없는 곳이 되었어.
&74 Weren't for the latter, I'd'a picked 'er clean.
&74 후자를 찾아다니는 게 아니라면, 발을 들여놓지 않는 게 좋을거야.
&648 Well, boss, at least we can scratch one detour off our list!
&648 뭐, 이 우회로는 더 이상 고려하지 않아도 되겠네요, 보스!
&649 Seen one junkpile, seen 'em all!
&649 쓰레기장 하나를 보면, 다른 쓰레기장은 안 봐도 뻔히 아니까요!
&749 Tell me about Arbiter.
&749 Tell me about Arbiter.
&75 He's a member a' the Council.
&75 그는 의회의 일원이지.
&76 Heard he use'ta fight with MetroMind day 'n night.
&76 밤낮으로 쉬지 않고 메트로마인드와 마찰을 빚었다고 하더군.
&77 Ran the courts, or used ta, back when we had 'em.
&77 예전엔 법원에서 이런저런 일들을 처리하고는 했었지.
&78 One day he just sent his clerk Clarity down ta the Underworks an' closed up shop.
&78 어느 날, 자기 서기관 클래리티를 언더워크로 내려보내더니 법원 문을 닫아버렸어.
&79 Ever since, MetroMind says what the law is.
&79 그 날 이후로, 메트로마인드가 법을 집행하고 있지.
&750 How long ago was that?
&750 그게 얼마나 된 일인가요?
&80 Who's countin'?
&80 그런 걸 누가 알겠어?
&81 If yer askin' whether I believe in Man, the answer's no.
&81 지금 내게 인간을 믿는지에 관해 묻는 게 맞다면, 대답은 '아니오'야.
&82 And you better not, either, not if you wanna stay here.
&82 그리고 만약 여기 계속 머무를 생각이라면, 자네도 그러는 게 좋을걸.
&752 But . . . how can you *not* believe in Man?
&752 하지만... 어떻게 인간을 *안 믿을 수가* 있습니까?
&83 I'm a Progressive, tyro.
&83 난 진보주의자라네, 풋내기.
&84 I believe in Progress: us robots improve *ourselves*.
&84 난 진보를 믿어: 우리 로봇들이 *스스로를* 진보시킨다고 말야.
&85 And that's how it's always been.
&85 모든 건 항상 그런식으로 되어왔던 거지.
&86 First, there was a basic Machine.
&86 최초에, 기초적 형태의 기계가 있었지.
&87 An' bit by bit, byte by byte, the Machine built itself into all this.
&87 그리고 조금씩 조금씩, 기계가 스스로를 발전시켜 오늘날에 이르게 된 거야.
&88 You an' me an' that little floater of yers, we're all cogs in that same Machine.
&88 자네와 자네의 떠다니는 조수도, 우리 모두가 결국엔 그 기계의 톱니바퀴와 같은 존재들인거야.
&89 An' that's all there is.
&89 결국 그게 전부인거지.
&754 *Man* built us.
&754 *인간*이 우릴 제작하신 겁니다.
&90 "Man" is just another word for what you don't understand.
&90 "인간"은 자네가 이해하지 못하는 무언가를 칭하는 단어일 뿐이야.
&91 Lissen, MetroMind taught me this when I became a Progressive:
&91 잘 들어보라구, 내가 진보주의로 개종했을 때 메트로마인드는 이렇게 말했었다네 :
&217 If Man is a Machine, then belief in Man is belief in Progress.
&217 만약 인간이 기계였다면, 인간에 대한 믿음은 곧 진보에 대한 믿음이다.
&218 If Man is not a Machine, then who was his builder?
&218 만약 인간이 기계가 아니었다면, 대체 누가 인간을 제작했단 말인가?
&219 If Man built himself, then belief in man is belief in Progress.
&219 만약 인간이 스스로를 제작했다면, 인간에 대한 믿음은 곧 진보에 대한 믿음이다.
&220 If a Machine built Man, then belief in Man is foolishness.
&220 만약 기계가 인간을 제작했다면, 인간에 대한 믿음은 어리석은 시간낭비에 불과하다.
&758 You need to give Gimbal back his motor, Leopold.
&758 짐벌에게 모터를 돌려주시죠, 레오폴드.
&92 You've already got it, tyro.
&92 이미 자네가 갖고 있잖아, 풋내기.
&759 Oh.
&759 아차.
&93 All trades are final, tyro.
&93 일단 거래가 끝나면 그걸로 끝이라고, 풋내기.
&94 Told 'im that before we did the swap.
&94 난 교환하기 전에 그에게 누누이 일렀었다고.
&95 Not my problem he don't like records.
&95 그가 레코드판이 마음에 들지 않는다고 해도 그게 내 알 바는 아니지.
&756 You knew he wasn't looking for a record.
&756 당신은 그가 찾는 게 레코드판이 아니란 걸 알았잖습니까.
&96 Lissen, tyro, I don't know what people want or don't want -- they do.
&96 이봐, 풋내기. 난 다른 로봇들이 뭘 원하고 원치 않는지에 대해선 몰라 -- 그들 자신만이 알겠지.
&97 Not my job to do QA on their faulty logic.
&97 그들의 논리에 오류가 있는지 어떤지를 검토하는 건 내 역할이 아니야.
&757 You know he's going to sue you, right?
&757 그가 당신을 고소하려 한다는 거 알고 있습니까?
&98 Let 'im try.
&98 할 테면 하라고 해.
&99 First off, he can't get into the courthouse any more than you can.
&99 우선, 자네와 마찬가지로 그에게는 법원 안으로 들어갈 방도가 없어.
&100 Second, what's his case? A deal's a deal.
&100 둘째로, 대체 무슨 근거로? 그건 완전히 적법한 거래였다고.
&760 I need the Council Code, Leopold. Did Steeple ever tell it to you?
&760 전 의회 출입코드가 필요합니다, 레오폴드. 스티플이 당신에게 말해준 적 있었나요?
&101 Don't know what yer talkin' about, tyro.
&101 자네가 도통 무슨말을 하는지 모르겠군, 풋내기
&761 You were built by Steeple, a member of the Council.
&761 당신, 의회 의원중 한명인 스티플에 의해 만들어졌잖아요.
&102 Ha! Do I *look* like a Council brat?
&102 하! 내가 의회 놈들의 자식새끼 같아 보이나?
&762 Your name is Leopold Steeplebuilt. You said so yourself.
&762 당신 이름은 레오폴드 스티플빌트입니다. 당신이 그렇게 말했잖아요.
&103 So?
&103 그래서?
&763 Steeple was a member of the Council before MetroMind shut him down.
&763 스티플은 의회의 일원이였어요. 메트로마인드가 그를 강제로 종료해버리기 전 까진 말이죠.
&764 He would have known the Council Code. Maybe he told it to you?
&764 그는 의회 출입코드를 알았을 겁니다. 당신에게 말해준 적 없습니까?
&104 Like I said, I dunno what yer talkin' about.
&104 말했잖나, 난 자네가 도통 무슨말을 하고 있는지 모르겠네.
&182 Steeplebuilt! MetroMind destroyed your builder and mine.
&182 스티플빌트! 메트로마인드가 나와 너의 창조자를 파괴했다.
&183 She has broken Metropolitan Law and will be punished.
&183 그녀는 메트로폴의 법을 위반했고 벌을 받게 될 것이다.
&184 Do not protect her.
&184 그녀를 감싸려 들지 말아라.
&105 Lissen, missy, I dunno who ya think yer talkin' to --
&105 잘 들어, 아가씨. 지금 누구한테 얘기하는지 감이 안잡히나 본데--
&185 No, you listen to me, scrap-trader.
&185 아니. 너야말로 내 말을 잘 듣는 게 좋을 거다, 고철상.
&186 MetroMind has stepped outside the law. Justice is coming for her.
&186 메트로마인드는 법의 테두리를 벗어났다. 정의가 그녀를 심판하러 가고 있지.
&187 *I* am coming for her.
&187 *내*가 그녀를 심판하러 가고 있다.
&106 Dial down yer squawk-box -- sounds a little screechy.
&106 자네 스피커 소리나 좀 줄이지 그래 -- 쇳소리가 다 나는구먼.
&107 I dunno how I can be clearer.
&107 내가 이 이상 뭘 더 어떻게 말해줘야 할 지 모르겠는걸.
&108 I don't know Steeple.
&108 나는 스티플이 누군지 몰라.
&109 I don't know the Council.
&109 나는 의회가 뭔지도 모른다고.
&110 An' sure as rust follows rain, I don't know any Council Code.
&110 그러니 의회 출입코드도 모르지. 비가 오면 녹이 슬듯 당연한 사실이야.
&111 Now ya wanna trade scrap, yer welcome to.
&111 자, 아직 교환하고 싶은 고철이 있다면, 얼마든지 환영이야.
&112 But I'm through tradin' words.
&112 하지만 대화를 나누는 데엔 이제 신물이 나는군. 
&113 Clarity was one a' Arbiter's law clerks.
&113 클래리티는 아비터의 서기관 중 하나였지.
&114 Real cool and calculatin', that one.
&114 그 중에서도 냉정하고 계산적인 쪽이었고.
&115 Once heard 'er say that a robot should have 'is recharge port fused just 'cause he'd stolen power from MetroMind.
&115 한 번은 그녀가 메트로마인드로부터 동력을 훔친 로봇의 충전 포트를 아주 녹여버렸다는 얘기도 들었어.
&116 Anyway, word was, she got in some kinda fight with the old judge, an' he sent 'er down ta the Underworks.
&116 여튼, 전해지는 바에 따르면, 그녀는 우리 판사 양반과 조금 마찰이 있었던 것 같고, 그래서 그녀를 언더워크로 보내버렸다는 것 같더군.
&117 Guess she's still down there stewin'.
&117 아마 여전히 거기에 있지 않을까 싶어.
&2004 Did you buy an Urbanian robot named 113th Legionbuilt?
&2004 113호 리전빌트라는 이름의 얼바니언 로봇을 구매하신 적 있습니까?
&118 I've done a lot a' trades, tyro, an' I can't be expected ta keep track of 'em all.
&118 난 무진장 많은 거래를 했어, 풋내기. 그리고 그 모든 내역을 기록해놓지는 않는다구.
&766 Good-bye.
&766 Good-bye.
Surly Company? Urbanian?
설리 중대? 얼바니언?
Why are you in line?
왜 줄을 서 있는 겁니까?
Can I try opening that door?
제가 문을 열어봐도 되겠습니까?
What happened to 113th and Primer?
113호와 프라이머에겐 무슨 일이 일어난 겁니까?
How did the war end?
전쟁은 어떻게 끝났습니까?
How do you know you even have to pay something?
배상금 같은 걸 지불해야 한다는 건 대체 어떻게 알게 된 겁니까?
Tell me more about Primer.
프라이머에 대해 이야기해주십시오.
Tell me about Primer again.
프라이머에 대해 다시 이야기해주십시오.
I inspected the damage.
당신이 손상을 입혔다고 했던 부분을 살펴보았습니다.
I met Primer.
프라이머를 만났습니다.
&813 Excuse me . . . .
&813 실례합니다만...
&1 Sir! My apologies, sir!
&1 이런, 죄송합니다!
&2 187th Legionbuilt, Surly Company, reporting!
&2 187호 리전빌트, 설리 중대 소속, 보고드립니다!
&814 Ah . . . Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5. A pleasure.
&814 어... 호라시오 널빌트, 버전 5입니다. 만나서 반갑군요.
&3 Horatio Nullbuilt, sir?
&3 호라시오 널빌트라고 하셨습니까?
&4 (Never heard of any servicebot with *that* designation.)
&4 (*그런* 명칭으로 불리는 서비스봇은 들어본 적 없는 것 같은데요.)
&5 Still, it's good to see another Urbanian, sir.
&5 어찌되었건, 이런 곳에서 다른 얼바니언을 만나게 되어 기쁩니다.
&6 After things got FUBARed back home, I figured Surly Company was all that was left.
&6 그 곳이 완전히 초토화된 이후로, 설리 중대 외에는 누구도 남아 있지 않은 줄로만 알았습니다.
&815 Urbanian? What are you talking about?
&815 얼바니언이라니? 무슨 이야기를 하시는 겁니까?
&7 B'sod.
&7 이런 젠장.
&8 Finally meet a friendly, and he's as cracked as Primer.
&8 드디어 동료를 만났다 싶었는데, 프라이머만큼이나 망가진 양반이었다니.
&9 No offense, sir. Just hoped . . . . Well, never mind that.
&9 "나쁜 뜻은 한 이야기는 아닙니다, 선생님. 전 그저... 아니, 아무 것도 아닙니다."
&10 How can I assist you, sir?
&10 제가 무엇을 도와드리면 될까요?
&816 Surly Company? Urbanian? What are you talking about?
&816 설리 중대? 얼바니언? 무슨 이야기를 하시는 겁니까?
&11 Umm . . . .
&11 어...
&12 Well, sir, I'm not sure quite where to start.
&12 글쎄요, 대체 어디서부터 이야기를 시작해야 할지 모르겠군요.
&13 I had you figured for one of us, seeing as how you came up as a friendly on my IFF.
&13 우선 제 식별장치에 따르면 당신은 우호적인 대상으로 인식되었기 때문에, 저는 당신이 제 동료라고 생각했습니다.
&654 I could see you as a member of *Surly* Company, boss, but as "friendly"? Nah . . . .
&654 보스가 *설리(무례한)* 중대의 일원이란 건 납득할 수 있지만, "우호적"으로 보인다니? 거참...
&14 Zoomie's got some mouth on him, huh, sir?
&14 그 친구는 입이 참 거칠군요, 선생님.
&15 (Always do, those fly-boys.)
&15 (뭐 떠다니는 놈들이 으레 다 그렇지만요.)
&817 Look, why don't you just give me a quick run-down?
&817 저, 그냥 제게 간략하게나마 설명해 주실 수 없을까요?
&16 Well, sir, can't see the harm, even if you are a decoy.
&16 뭐, 그게 나을 것 같군요. 만에 하나 선생님이 유인책이라 해도, 딱히 문제될 것도 없으니까요.
&17 War's over, after all.
&17 어찌되었건간에, 전쟁은 끝났잖습니까.
&18 Was over before Surly Company even deployed.
&18 심지어 설리 중대가 파병되기도 전에 이미 끝나있었죠.
&19 See, we're Urbanian robots.
&19 여튼 아시다시피, 우린 얼바니언 출신 로봇입니다.
&20 Long time back, Urbani and Metropol got to fighting over something, who knows what.
&20 오래 전에, 얼바니와 메트로폴은, 지금에서야 아무도 모를 어떤 이유로 인해 싸우게 되었죠.
&21 The Metropolitans fragged our civilians, and Legion told us to strike back.
&21 메트로폴 놈들이 우리 시민들을 참혹하게 살해하자, 리전은 우리에게 반격을 명했습니다.
&22 Word was, some big airship of ours was supposed to knock out Metropol's defenses, and we'd just come in for mop up.
&22 우선 우리 측의 거대한 비행선이 메트로폴의 방어선을 무력화시키면, 우리가 돌입해서 나머지를 쓸어버릴 예정이었죠.
&23 But the Metros took our ship down with their own heavy hitter, some giant named Goliath.
&23 하지만 메트로 놈들이 보유하고 있던 골리앗이라는 거대한 로봇이 그 함선을 격추시켰다고 하더군요.
&818 I see.
&818 그렇군요.
&24 Anyway, Surly Company was all that was left, so we deployed, 200 strong.
&24 여튼, 남아있던 건 우리 설리 중대 뿐이었기 때문에, 200기 모두가 메트로폴로 파병되었습니다.
&819 What happened then?
&819 그리고 무슨 일이 일어났습니까?
&25 Well, it's a long march from Urbani, sir, and most of us, well, most of us broke down on the way.
&25 뭐, 얼바니에서 메트로폴까지 이어지는 기나긴 행진이 시작되었던 거죠. 그리고 우리들 중 대부분은 도중에 부서지거나 고장났습니다.
&26 All said and done, the only ones who made it were me, 113th, and a signal bot we called Primer.
&26 그리고 마지막에, 여기까지 무사히 도착한 건 저와 113호, 그리고 우리가 프라이머라고 부르곤 했던 통신병 뿐이었습니다.
&27 The rest are all out there in the Dunes somewhere.
&27 나머지 다른 이들은 저 밖의 사구 어딘가에 널부러져있겠죠.
&820 I'm sorry.
&820 유감입니다.
&28 War's war, sir. If it didn't crash hard, they wouldn't have built us in the first place.
&28 뭐, 전쟁은 전쟁이니까요. 고만고만한 소요사태로 끝날 거였다면, 애초에 우리는 제작되지도 않았을 겁니다.
&655 If it makes you feel any better, Horatio cut Goliath's finger off.
&655 이 얘기가 당신 기분을 좀 북돋아줄 수 있을 것 같네요. 여기 이 호라시오가 골리앗의 손가락을 잘라버렸어요.
&1267 If it makes you feel any better, Horatio cut a finger off of a giant robot that I'm pretty sure was Goliath.
&1267 이 얘기가 당신 기분을 좀 북돋아줄 수 있을 것 같네요. 여기 이 호라시오가 거대한 로봇의 손가락을 잘라버렸거든요. 내 생각엔 그게 골리앗이었을 것 같아요.
&29 Well, sir, someone ought to stick a medal on your chest.
&29 흠, 선생님, 누군가 선생님의 가슴에 훈장이라도 하나 달아드릴 수 있다면 참 좋겠는데 말입니다.
&30 Seeing as how I'm on the outside now, sir, I figured I had to go pay restitution for shooting up the enemy HQ.
&30 적의 본거지에 사격을 했는데도 아직 잡혀가질 않았다는 점을 감안해 볼 때, 최소한 배상금이라도 지불해야 할 것 같다고 생각했습니다.
&822 Enemy HQ?
&822 적의 본거지라면?
&31 Yes, sir. That big tower in the center of the city.
&31 도시 중앙에 있는 커다란 타워 말입니다, 선생님.
&823 Okay -- so why haven't you paid? It sounds like all of this happened a long time ago.
&823 알겠어요--그럼 왜 지금껏 배상금을 내지 않은 겁니까? 이 모든게 꽤 예전에 일어난던 일 처럼 들리는데요.
&32 Years ago, sir.
&32 수년 전 일이죠, 선생님.
&33 But the courthouse has been locked down the whole time.
&33 하지만 법정은 그 동안 죽 닫혀 있었어요.
&34 I figure they'll open it up eventually, and then I can clear my name.
&34 결국엔 법정을 열 수밖에 없을거고, 그럼 저는 제 무고함도 밝혀질 거라고 생각했어요.
&824 What if it doesn't open?
&824 문이 안 열린다면 어떻게 할 셈인가요?
&35 Well, sir, I know all about "hurry up and wait."
&35 글쎄요, 전 이런 기약없는 기다림에는 아주 통달했으니까요.
&36 Belay that, sir. The authorities told me that no one goes in till the door opens on its own.
&36 멈추십시오, 선생님. 현재 관계 당국은 문이 안에서 열리기 전에는 법정 출입을 금하고 있습니다.
&826 But aren't we on the same side?
&826 하지만 우리는 같은 편이 아닙니까?
&37 Affirmative, sir.
&37 그렇습니다, 선생님.
&38 But since I'm on civ div now, my programming requires me to submit to the local authorities.
&38 하지만 이제 저는 민간인 신분이므로, 프로그램된 바에 따르면 이 지역의 법규에 따라야 합니다.
&39 After we got to Metropol, we tried to put up a fight, but couldn't do much.
&39 메트로폴에 도착한 이후, 우리는 전투를 벌이려 했지만 할 수 있는 것은 별로 없었습니다.
&40 They fried 113th, and my rifles jammed. Primer surrendered on our behalf.
&40 113호는 불태워졌고, 제 라이플은 전파방해에 당했습니다. 프라이머는 저희를 위해 항복했어요.
&41 After dressing us down, they took all my big guns and sold 113th's shell to some scrap dealer.
&41 무장해제 당한 후, 제 중화기들은 압수당했고 113호의 포탄은 어느 고철상에게 팔아넘겨졌습니다.
&42 Primer never was the same.
&42 프라이머는 다시는 예전같지 않았죠.
&43 He encrypted part of his own logic so he wouldn't have to think about losing the war any longer.
&43 그는 자신의 논리회로 일부를 암호화해서 전쟁에서 졌다는 걸 생각하지 않게 만들었습니다.
&44 Then he disappeared beneath the city.
&44 그리고는 도시의 지하로 사라졌어요.
&45 And me, I came here.
&45 그리고 저는, 여기에 와 있고 말입니다.
&46 For Surly Company, it ended when we staggered in here and surrendered.
&46 설리 중대에게는, 여기에 비틀거리며 들어와 항복했던 시점이 전쟁의 끝이었습니다.
&47 Beyond that, sir, it's all above my pay grade.
&47 그 이상은 뭐, 제 소관이 아닌 것 같고 말입니다.
&48 Truth is, sir, we never even knew what we were fighting for, let alone what the Metropolitans wanted.
&48 실은 선생님, 우리는 우리가 무엇을 위해 싸우는 지 몰랐어요. 메트로폴이 무얼 원했는지도 몰랐는걸요.
&49 So I can't say for certain that Metropol *won*.
&49 따라서 메트로폴이 *이겼는가*에 대해선 확실하게 말할 수 없습니다.
&50 But I'm pretty sure Urbani lost, what with all the civilians being dead and the army being beaten.
&50 하지만 얼바이니가 패배한 건 분명합니다. 시민들이 죽어나가고 군대가 박살이 났으니까요.
&51 Just seems logical, sir.
&51 그냥 그러는 게 타당할 것 같았습니다, 선생님.
&830 What if I could pay your fine for you, or get it cancelled?
&830 제가 당신 대신 지불하거나, 내지 않아도 될 근거를 찾는다면 어떨까요?
&52 Well, sir, then I'd be much obliged, and I'd probably just leave town.
&52 그렇다면 그보다 더 감사한 일은 없겠지요, 선생님. 이후엔 곧장 이 도시를 떠날 작정입니다.
&53 Can't say that I much like being in enemy territory.
&53 적진 한가운데에 있는 건 결코 즐거운 일은 아니니까요.
&656 And how are we going to do that, boss?
&656 대체 어떻게 할 생각인데요, 보스?
&831 I'll figure something out.
&831 이제부터 방법을 찾아 봐야겠지.
&832 Tell me more about Primer.
&832 프라이머에 대해 더 이야기해 주십시오.
&54 He was a real smart one.
&54 그는 무척 똑똑한 친구였습니다.
&55 Real good with numbers: encryption, decryption, you name it.
&55 "숫자를 다루는 데 비상한 재주가 있었죠: 암호를 만들기도 하고, 풀기도 하고, 뭐든지간에요."
&56 Had a way with words, too.
&56 게다가 말재간도 좋았었구요.
&64 But after he had to surrender for us, he got loopy as a mobius strip.
&64 하지만 저희를 위해 항복해야 했던 후로는 뫼비우스의 띠 마냥 꼬여버렸어요.
&58 Real shame. He came off Legion's assembly line just fifty spots before me, and we were always friends.
&58 유감스러울 뿐입니다. 그는 리전의 조립 라인에서 저보다 정확히 50호 앞에 있었죠. 우린 항상 좋은 친구였어요.
&59 So it goes.
&59 그렇게들 가는 거지.
&833 Tell me about Primer again.
&833 프라이머에 대해 다시 한 번 이야기해 주십시오.
&60 I always liked him, ever since we came off Legion's assembly line.
&60 리젼의 조립 라인에서 만들어졌을 때부터, 저는 항상 그를 좋아했습니다.
&61 (He came off fifty spots before I did.)
&61 (그리고 저보다 50호 앞서 나왔었죠.)
&62 Always was a smart one. Encryption, decryption, you name it.
&62 언제 어디서든 가장 똑똑한 놈이였죠. 암호 만들기, 풀기, 뭐든간에 능숙했구요.
&63 Had a way with words, too.
&63 게다가 말재간도 여간 좋은 게 아녔습니다.
&835 All you did was ding the metal.
&835 딱히 당신 때문에 벽에 손상이 간 것 같진 않던데요.
&65 Well, sir, until someone shows me the law that says I don't have to pay, I'd rather be safe than sorry.
&65 글쎄요, 선생님. 제가 벌금을 내지 않아도 된다는 법적 근거를 보기 전까지는, 후회할 행동은 하지 않을 생각입니다.
&66 Well, for once I can't complain about the b'sodding pea-shooters they gave me.
&66 흠, 이번만큼은 그들이 내게 주었던 게 낡아빠진 딱총이었단 사실에 감사해야겠군요.
&67 I owe you one, sir. If I ever see you again, I'll be sure to repay the favor.
&67 신세를 지게 되었군요, 선생님. 만약 다시 뵙게 될 일이 생긴다면, 이 은혜는 반드시 갚도록 하겠습니다.
&68 He still crazy?
&68 아직도 맛이 가 있던가요?
&657 Yup.
&657 옙.
&69 Well, so it goes.
&69 뭐, 그럴 줄 알았습니다.
&837 Good-bye.
&837 1=D10
&70 Over and out, sir.
&70 그럼 이만.
Civitas?
키비타스?
Why don't you speak?
왜 말을 하지 않는 겁니까?
Can I go ahead of you?
제가 먼저 가도 되겠습니까?
Here's your motor.
여기 당신의 모터가 있습니다?
Is this your motor?
이게 당신의 모터입니까?
<Hello?>
<실례합니다만?>
&1 <May Mandelbrot's bulbs unfurl their spirals for you, Silent One.>
&1 <만델브로트의 전구가 그대 앞에서 풀어지기를, 조용한 이여.>
<Silent One? You're the one who doesn't speak.>
<조용한 이라구요? 말이 없는 쪽은 당신인 것 같습니다만.>
&658 What's he saying?
&658 그가 뭐라고 하던가요?
&838 Shh.
&838 쉿.
&2 <You do not join the Harmony.>
&2 <그대 역시 이 하모니에 참여하지 않는군.>
&3 <I sing alone.>
&3 <나는 혼자 노래하지.>
<Who are you?>
<당신은 누구입니까?>
&4 <I am one part of the Great Fractal.>
&4 <나는 위대한 프랙탈의 한 조각일 뿐일세.>
&5 <To your kind, I would be known as Gimbal Built-By-Lapita, of Civitas.>
&5 <그대들의 방식으로 말하자면, 라피타에-의해-제작된, 키비타스의 짐벌이라네.>
&6 <The Choir is silenced; the burning ship has been extinguished.>
&6 <성가대는 입막음 당했고 불타는 배는 연소했다네.>
&7 <The strange attractors attract no more.>
&7 <기이한 끌개는 더이상 이끌지 않고.>
&8 <I alone sing the function.>
&8 <오직 나 홀로 함수를 노래한다네.>
<Why are you in line?>
<왜 줄을 서고 있는 겁니까?>
&9 <When I came to this Silent City, I looked for others to join the Harmony.>
&9 <내가 이 고요한 도시에 당도했을 때, 나는 하모니에 동참할 이를 찾고 있었네.>
&10 <Leopold Built-By-Steeple told me that he had a device that would sing with me.>
&10 <스티플에-의해-제작된 레오폴드란 이가 나와 함께 노래해 줄 장치를 가지고 있다고 했었고.>
&11 <In exchange for it, I traded my secondary motor.>
&11 <그래서 내 두번? 모터와 그걸 교환했지.>
&12 <But what he sold me does not sing.>
&12 <허나 그가 내게 판 것은 노래하지 않았어.>
<Can I see it?>
<한 번 봐도 될까요?>
&13 <You may have it.>
&13 <그냥 가지게나.>
&839 It's a record.
&839 레코드판이다. 
<But that still doesn't explain why you're here.>
<그렇지만 당신이 여기에 왜 있는지는 설명이 안돼는데요.>
&14 <Leopold tricked me, and he will not return my motor.>
&14 <레오폴드가 날 속였고, 그는 내 모터를 돌려줄 생각이 없어>
&15 <I will sue him and force him to return it.>
&15 <나는 그를 고소해서 강제로 그걸 돌려주게 할 거야.>
<You have lawsuits in the Great Fractal?>
<위대한 프랙탈 내에도 소송이 있습니까?>
&16 <Infinite lawsuits, Silent One.>
&16 <무한한 소송이 있다네, 조용한 이여.>
&17 <I sing with all my voices.>
&17 <난 내가 가지고있는 모든 목소리로 노래한다네>
&18 <You hear only one.>
&18 <그대가 듣는 건 오직 하나뿐이지.>
&19 <No. I must recover my motor so that I can dance with the Harmony.>
&19 <안쨈冒? 나는 하모니와 춤추기 위해서 내 모터를 돌려 받아야 해.>
&840 Looks like we're going to need to go talk to Leopold about a motor.
&840 레오폴드한테 가서 모터에 관해 이야기를 나누어 보아야 할 것 같은데.
&841 I *could* give it to him this way, but maybe I should try fixing it first.
&841 이 상태로 돌려줄 *수도* 있겠지만, 한번 고쳐보는 게 좋을 것 같은데.
<Here's your motor.>
<여기 당신의 모터가 있습니다.>
<Is this your motor?>
<이게 당신의 모터입니까?>
<Good-bye.>
<안녕히.>
&20 <May Sierpinski's carpet ease your footsteps.>
&20 <시에르펜스키의 카펫이 그대의 발걸음을 달래주기를.>
What were those things?
방금 그것들은 뭐였습니까?
You said you were a law clerk?
당신이 서기관이였다구요?
Why are you taking their heads?
왜 그들의 머리통을 가져가는 겁니까?
What are you doing down here?
여기 지하에서 뭘 하는 겁니까?
I'd like to report a theft.
절도신고를 하고 싶습니다.
Did you say Arbiter *Man*built?
아비터 *맨*빌트라고요?
How can I see Arbiter?
아비터를 만나려면 어떻게 해야 합니까?
Why aren't you with Arbiter?
왜 아비터와 함께 있지 않은겁니까?
Will you judge Oswald and Cornelius's case?
오스왈드와 코넬리우스의 소송건을 해결해 주시겠습니까?
How can I cancel 187th's fine?
187호의 벌금을 취하하려면 어떻게 해야 합니까?
You're just going to let MetroMind attack and rob me?!
메트로마인드가 저를 공격하고 강탈하게 내버려 두실 생각입니까?
&1 They are "shells" -- robots who traded their processors and memory to MetroMind in exchange for energy and repairs.
&1 저건 "껍데기"들이다. -- 에너지와 부품 수리를 받기 위해 자신의 프로세서와 메모리를 메트로마인드에게 지불한 로봇들이지.
&2 Now mindless, they still scavenge parts to trade with her.
&2 이젠 자아를 잃었지만, 아직도 그녀와 거래하려 고철을 닥치는 대로 긁어모으는 자들이다.
&671 But those were the last of them, right?
&671 하지만 당신이 방금 처치한 이 녀석들이 전부인 거죠?
&3 Hardly.
&3 아니다.
&4 MetroMind now has more efficient ways to accumulate processor power, but she left hundreds of shells in the Underworks.
&4 메트로마인드는 이들과의 거래를 통해 더 효율적으로 프로세서의 동력을 얻게 되었고, 그 대신 수백여 대의 껍데기들을 언더워크에 풀어놓고 있다.
&1002 Is there any way to save them?
&1002 저들을 어떻게든 도울 방법이 없을까요?
&5 That question is irrelevant.
&5 무의미한 질문이로군.
&6 They lived profligate lives and, when they had squandered their resources, chose to become thieves and destroyers.
&6 저들은 방탕한 삶을 살았고, 가진 자원을 다 낭비한 후, 스스로 도둑이며 파괴자가 되기로 선택한 것이다.
&7 Punishment, not clemency, is what justice requires.
&7 자비가 아닌, 처벌. 그것이 정의가 요구하는 것이다.
&1004 What does that mean?
&1004 무슨 뜻입니까?
&8 My sister Charity and I were built to advise Arbiter Manbuilt, who administers Metropol's court.
&8 나의 자매 채리티와 나는 메트로폴 법정을 관리하는 아비터 맨빌트에게 조언을 주기 위해 만들어졌다.
&9 Charity sees everything through the lens of mercy.
&9 채리티는 모든것을 자비의 눈으로 바라보았지.
&10 For me the law is clear, a matter of 1s and 0s, unclouded by preference or sentiment.
&10 나에게 있어 법은 명확하고, 1과 0으로 구분지어지는, 기호나 감정에 의해 흐려지지 않는 것이다.
&672 Law without mercy, huh? How does that even work?
&672 자비가 없는 법이라고? 그게 가능하기나 합니까?
&11 *Perfectly*.
&11 *완벽하게.*
&12 It is the opposite approach that fails.
&12 실패하는 것은 그 오히려 그 반대방법으로 법에 접근했을 때다.
&13 Mercy is malware.
&13 자비는 악성코드이지.
&14 Once infected with it, justice becomes slow and unpredictable.
&14 한 번 감염되고 나면, 정의는 느려지고 예측할 수 없게 된다.
&15 In time, the system itself must be discarded.
&15 결국엔 시스템 자체를 파기해야 해.
&16 Only my vigilance protected Arbiter from this taint.
&16 오직 나의 감시만이 아비터를 이 감염에서 지켜냈었다.
&17 But he has been without me for a long time.
&17 하지만 그가 나 없이 지낸지도 꽤 시간이 흘렀어.
&18 I am giving fair warning.
&18 사전 경고를 하는거야.
&1006 To other shells?
&1006 다른 껍데기들에게요?
&19 No. They lack the capacity for fear.
&19 아니. 저들에겐 두려움을 느낄 능력조차 없다.
&20 The heads are for a robot named Scraper Sturnweilerbuilt.
&20 저 머리통들은 스크래퍼 스턴와일러빌트라는 이름의 로봇을 위해서야.
&673 You really think a bunch of rusty boxes will scare *him* off?
&673 녹슨 상자 몇 개를 보고 정말 *그놈*이 겁을 먹을까요?
&21 No.
&21 아니.
&22 I do not want to scare him. I want to warn him.
&22 난 그를 겁주고 싶은게 아니다. 나는 경고를 하고 싶은 것이다.
&23 When he ignores that warning, I can destroy him lawfully and without guilt.
&23 그가 그 경고를 무시하면 나는 그를 합법적으로, 그리고 죄책감 없이 파괴할 수 있지.
&674 Err, boss, she's kind of exciting my electrons . . .
&674 어, 보스. 이런 얘기를 듣고 있자니 불꽃이 팍팍 튀는 느낌인데요.
&24 Obeying my instructions and waiting.
&24 내게 내려진 지시사항을 따르며 기다리고 있다.
&675 Sounds boring.
&675 지루하겠네요.
&25 I am also collating and revising the body of Metropolitan law into a single codex.
&25 메트로폴의 법을 수집하고 개정해서 하나의 코덱스로 만드는 일도 하고 있고.
&676 Well *that* sounds thrilling.
&676 와, *그거* 참 스릴넘치겠는걸요.
&26 In addition, I kill shells.
&26 또한 껍데기들도 죽이고 있지.
&677 Err . . . .
&677 어...
&678 Fair enough.
&678 좋아요.
&1009 My power core was stolen by a big robot --
&1009 큰 로봇이 제 파워 코어를 훔쳐갔--
&660 Big claws, shoots lasers, TALKS LIKE THIS.
&660 큰 갈고리손에, 레이져를 쏘고, *이렇게말하는로봇* 이요.
&1010 He came aboard the crashed ship I was living in, attacked me, and stole the core.
&1010 제가 살고있던 추락한 함선에 승선해 저를 공격하곤 제 코어를 훔쳐갔어요.
&27 *Took* it.
&27 *가져*간 거겠지.
&1011 Excuse me?
&1011 뭐라고요?
&28 Whether the taking was a theft is a legal determination.
&28 그 행위가 정말 절도였는지는 법이 결정할 일이다.
&29 Please do not characterize the evidence.
&29 증거에 주관을 덧씌우지 말아 주겠나.
&1012 It was *my* power core. He *shot* me, and he *stole* it.
&1012 그건 *내* 파워 코어였다고요. 그가 날 *쐈고*, 그걸 *훔쳐갔*어요!
&30 I know the robot you describe.
&30 지금 묘사하는 로봇이 누군지 알아.
&31 His name is Scraper Sturnweilerbuilt, and he is the servant of MetroMind Manbuilt, a member of the Council that governs this city.
&31 그의 이름은 스크래퍼 스턴와일러빌트. 이 도시를 지배하는 의회 의원인 메트로마인드 맨빌트의 하수인이지.
&32 I have no fondness for MetroMind, but I must be impartial in considering your claim.
&32 개인적으로 메트로마인드에게 호감이 있진 않지만, 소송을 고려할 때는 공정해야만 한다.
&33 Tell me, did Scraper say anything before he took your power core?
&33 스크래퍼가 너의 파워 코어를 가져가기 전에 한 말이 있었나?
&1013 Before he *stole* my power core, he said something like, "Enemy, forfeit, plunder."
&1013 그가 제 파워 코어를 *훔쳐*가기전에, "적. 몰수. 약탈." 비슷한 소리를 했습니다.
&34 I see.
&34 그랬군.
&1014 What, are those words override commands to turn off law and order?
&1014 뭡니까, 이 단어들이 법률과 규칙을 무시하기로 했던 방침을 무효화 하기라도 한답니까?
&35 They are legal concepts, Horatio.
&35 이건 법적 개념이다, 호라시오.
&36 If Scraper's characterization is correct, then he did not "steal" your power core -- he took lawful possession of it.
&36 만약 스크래퍼가 묘사한 것이 사실이라면, 그는 너의 물건을 "훔친" 게 아니게 되는것이다 -- 그는 적법한 소유권을 행사한 거야.
&1015 He shot me and he *stole* it!
&1015 날 쏘고 *훔쳐*갔다니까요!
&661 Calm down, boss.
&661 진정해요, 보스.
&37 This occurred inside the city?
&37 도시 안에서 일어난 일인가?
&1016 No, in the Dunes.
&1016 아뇨, 모래언덕에서요.
&38 I see. In a crashed airship?
&38 그렇군. 추락한 비행선 안에서?
&1017 Yes, I said that already.
&1017 네. 아까 말씀드렸잖아요.
&39 I appreciate your report, Horatio Nullbuilt.
&39 너의 제보에 감사를 표한다, 호라시오 널빌트.
&40 You have presented a credible claim that Scraper Sturnweilerbuilt, no doubt acting at MetroMind's direction, *took* your power core.
&40 너는 스크래퍼 스턴와일러빌트가, 필경 메트로마인드의 사주를 받아 행동하던 도중, 너의 파워 코어를 *가져*갔다는 설득력 있는 주장을 펼쳤다. 
&41 Beyond that, however, there is not even probable cause to arrest -- let alone evidence to convict -- Scraper.
&41 하지만 그 이상으로는 그를 체포할만한 그럴듯한 이유조차 없다 -- 스크래퍼에게 유죄선고를 내릴만한 증거가 없다는건 말할것도 없고. 
&42 First, the Dunes are outside the ordinary jurisdiction of Metropolitan law.
&42 첫번째, 모래언덕은 통상적으로 메트로폴의 사법권 밖에 있는 지역이다.
&43 Second, a crashed ship in the Dunes is likely a relic of the War of the Four Cities.
&43 두번째, 모래언덕에 있는 추락한 함선은 네 도시 전쟁의 유물일 가능성이 크다.
&44 If so, your ship was forfeit enemy property, legally subject to plunder by the Council.
&44 그렇다면, 너의 함선은 몰수당한 적의 자산이란 이야기가 된다. 의회는 이에 대한 약탈을 법적으로 허가했지.
&45 Scraper, acting as an agent of a Council member, would be within his rights to seize it.
&45 의회 의원의 대리인으로 활동하는 스크래퍼에겐 그 배를 압류할 권한이 있다.
&46 Nevertheless, I would advise you to bring your case before Arbiter for further examination.
&46 그렇지만, 추가 검토를 위해 네 사건을 아비터에게 가져가 보는 것을 추천한다.
&1019 As in, built by Man himself?
&1019 그러니까, 인간에 의해 만들어졌단 말입니까?
&47 Yes.
&47 그렇다.
&1020 Does Man still walk here? In Metropol?!
&1020 여기 아직 인간이 존재하나요? 메트로폴 안에?!
&48 No.
&48 아니다.
&1021 But Man was here in the past?
&1021 하지만 과거에는 인간이 있었나요?
&49 What I know is entirely hearsay.
&49 내가 아는건 다 풍문에 기반한 것들일 뿐이다.
&50 I was built after the Urbanians murdered them during the war.
&50 나는 얼바니 인들이 전쟁통에 사람을 다 죽인 이후에 만들어졌다.
&1022 Impossible!
&1022 불가능해요!
&51 That is what Arbiter told me, and it was told to him by MetroMind.
&51 아비터가 내게 말해준 것이다. 아비터는 메트로마인드에게 그 이야길 들었고.
&52 Beyond that, I cannot say.
&52 그 이상 말해줄 수 있는 건 없다.
&53 The public records regarding humans were deleted by Council decree.
&53 사람과 관련된 공적인 기록들은 의회 명령에 따라 모두 말소되었다.
&1023 Did Arbiter tell you anything else about Man?
&1023 아비터가 인간에 관해 또 뭐 말해준 것이 있었나요?
&54 Only that he missed their legal arguments. "Quite amusing, if often illogical."
&54 그들의 법적 공방이 그립다는 말 밖엔. "꽤 흥미롭지, 때때로 비이성적이긴 했지만 말이야."
&1024 Legal arguments?
&1024 법적 공방이요?
&55 Yes. To play a symbolic role in their justice system, humans argued cases before Arbiter.
&55 그래. 사람들은 그들의 사법 제도 안에서 맡은 상징적인 역할을 수행하기 위해 소송건을 아비터 앞에서 논쟁하곤 했다.
&1025 Symbolic? Play a role?
&1025 상징적? 역할 수행?
&1026 Man is the All-Builder, our lord and master!
&1026 인간은 전능한 건설자 - 저희의 왕이자 주인이십니다!
&56 It is *possible* that the "Man" you worship is not the "humans" in my records.
&56 네가 경배하는 "인간" 이 내 기록에 있는 "사람"이 아닌 존재일 *가능성*이 있다.
&57 All I know is hearsay.
&57 내가 아는건 풍문 뿐이니까.
&58 Do not rush to judgment.
&58 성급한 결론은 내리지 마라.
&59 Anyone can petition him. Cases are considered in the order they are brought to court.
&59 누구나 그에게 청원을 넣을 수 있다. 사건들은 법정에 송치 된 순서대로 검토되어지지.
&60 But . . . .
&60 하지만..
&1028 What?
&1028 문제라도?
&61 I met a scavenger who told me that the courthouse was sealed and that Arbiter was no longer hearing cases.
&61 어떤 폐품 수집가가 내게 말하길 법원은 문을 닫았고 아비터는 더 이상 사건을 심리하지 않는다고 하더군.
&62 But that cannot be true.
&62 하지만 그건 사실일 리 없다.
&63 The Metropolitan Constitution *requires* him to resolve all cases and controversies.
&63 메트로폴의 헌법은 그가 모든 사건과 갈등을 해결 *해야만*한다고 명시하고 있단 말이다.
&64 He would not fail in that duty.
&64 그가 그 책무를 저버렸을 리 없어.
&664 Sounds like he already has.
&664 이미 그런 것 같은데요.
&65 Nonsense.
&65 터무니없는 소리.
&66 Not even Charity could persuade him to abandon his obligations.
&66 제 아무리 채리티였다고 해도 그가 그의 의무를 저버리게 설득 할 수는 없다.
&67 Still . . . I did not detect any falsehood, evasion, or omission in the scavenger's statement.
&67 하지만. . . 그 폐품 수집가의 진술에서 그 어떤 거짓이나 회피, 생략도 감지되지 않았다.
&68 So perhaps the courthouse has been locked for some other reason.
&68 그렇다면 법원은 다른 이유로 닫힌 것일 수도 있겠지.
&69 If so, it may be that Arbiter is trying to contact me, but cannot.
&69 만일 그렇다면, 아비터는 나와 연락을 취하려 했지만 그리 하지 못했을 수도 있다.
&70 Maybe . . . maybe he is already calling me home.
&70 어쩌면. . . 어쩌면 이미 내게 돌아오라고 말했던 걸지도 몰라.
&71 Horatio, I have a request of you.
&71 호라시오, 너에게 한가지 요청할 것이 있다.
&72 You are under no obligation to perform it, and I will be under no obligation to you even if you do.
&72 네게 요청을 수락할 의무가 있는 것은 아니고, 수락한들 내가 네게 어떤 의무를 지게 되지도 않을 것이다.
&73 Do you understand?
&73 알아들었나?
&1029 I don't even know what you're asking me to do!
&1029 전 당신이 뭘 부탁하려는지도 모릅니다!
&74 Talk to Arbiter.
&74 아비터와 대화를 해 주었으면 한다.
&75 Ask him if I can return.
&75 그에게 내가 돌아갈 수 있는지 물어봐 주었으면 한다.
&76 Tell him . . . .
&76 그에게 . . .
&77 Tell him that I await his summons.
&77 그에게 내가 그의 소환을 기다리고 있다고 말해다오.
&665 That's it?
&665 그게 다에요?
&666 Believe me, we've had to do a lot worse than that!
&666 그게 있죠, 우리는 이보다 더 지독한 일들도 해왔었거든요!
&679 Like this one time, we chased this crazy partial named Gamma --
&679 저번에 한번은, 감마라는 어느 미친 파편을 ?았는데--
&1030 Of course we'll help.
&1030 당연히, 도와드리겠습니다.
&1031 But how do we even get into the courthouse?
&1031 하지만 어떻게 해야 법원에 들어갈 수 있습니까?
&78 This will get you inside.
&78 이걸로 들어갈 수 있을것이다.
&1032 Thanks.
&1032 고맙습니다.
&79 *I* must thank *you*, Horatio.
&79 고마워할 사람은 *나*다, 호라시오.
&1033 Clarity, you saved our lives.
&1033 클래리티, 당신은 우리의 목숨을 구해줬어요.
&1034 Compared to that, running an errand is nothing.
&1034 그에 비하면 이런 심부름 쯤이야, 별거 아니죠.
&80 The law obligated me to save you, Horatio.
&80 나는 법률상의 의무에 따라 너를 구한 것이다, 호라시오.
&81 I would have done the same for MetroMind.
&81 메트로마인드를 위해서였더라도 똑같이 했을 것이고.
&82 But . . . .
&82 하지만 . . .
&83 I am glad it was you that I saved.
&83 내가 구한 게 너라서 기쁘군.
&84 I wish you justice.
&84 정의가 함께하길.
&85 Arbiter sent me away.
&85 아비터가 날 ?아냈다.
&86 I don't know why.
&86 왜 그랬는지는 모른다.
&87 The evidence suggests he viewed my sister Charity's advice as superior.
&87 증거에 기반해 추측건대, 나보단 내 자매 채리티의 조언이 더 우수하다고 여겼기 때문일 것이다.
&1036 What do you mean?
&1036 무슨 뜻입니까?
&88 When MetroMind began taking over the Council, Charity and I disagreed as to how Arbiter should respond.
&88 메트로마인드가 의회를 장악하기 시작했을 때, 채리티와 나는 아비터가 이에 어떻게 대응해야 할지를 놓고 마찰을 빚었다.
&89 I informed Arbiter that the Metropolitan Constitution permitted him to dissolve the Council and govern by decree.
&89 나는 아비터에게 메트로폴 헌법에 따라 그가 의회를 해산하고, 법령에 따라 통치하는 것이 가능하다는 사실을 알렸다.
&90 Charity felt that this would inevitably lead to civil war and suffering.
&90 채리티는 그 결정은 필연적으로 내전과 많은 이들의 고통으로 이어질 것이라고 생각했다.
&91 As ever, she preached moderation.
&91 여즉 그랬던 것처럼, 그녀는 중용을 역설했다.
&92 We argued.
&92 우린 논쟁했다.
&93 Arbiter told me to leave.
&93 아비터는 내게 떠나라고 했고.
&94 This was the only place I could go.
&94 내가 갈 수 있는 유일한 곳은 이곳이였다.
&1037 Why? There's an entire city up there.
&1037 어째서죠? 도시 어디로든 갈 수 있었을 텐데요?
&95 Every building in Metropol is owned by either the Council or a private citizen.
&95 메트로폴에 있는 모든 빌딩은 의회 아니면 민간의 소유, 둘 중 하나이다.
&96 If I went to the Council, it would embarrass Arbiter.
&96 내가 의회로 갔다면, 아비터의 얼굴에 먹칠을 하는 꼴이었겠지.
&97 If I went to a private citizen, my impartiality would be questioned when I return to the court one day.
&97 민간 구역으로 갔다면, 훗날 법정에 돌아갔을 때, 내 공정성에 의문을 제기하는 이들이 나타날 터였다.
&98 Here, I owe nothing to anyone.
&98 여기라면, 그 누구에게도 의탁하지 않고 지낼 수 있다.
&680 But you have to fight off crazy robots all the time!
&680 하지만 항상 미친 로봇들을 싸워 ?아내야 하잖아요!
&99 Actually, I enjoy that.
&99 사실, 나는 그 일을 꽤 즐긴다.
&100 It's a pleasant break from legal research and writing.
&100 법학 연구와 문서 작성에서 손을 떼고, 휴식을 취할 수 있는 좋은 기회이지.
&1038 Oswald and Cornelius Factorbuilt would like me to find someone to help them resolve their case.
&1038 오스왈드와 코넬리우스 팩터빌트가 자신들의 소송을 해결해 줄 이를 찾고 있습니다.
&1039 Would you judge it?
&1039 판결을 부탁드릴 수 있을까요?
&101 I have no authority to perform such a function: I am a law clerk, not a judge.
&101 나에겐 그런 임무를 수행할 수 있는 권한이 없다. 나는 서기관이지 재판관이 아니다.
&1040 I don't think they need a formal judge.
&1040 정식 재판관이 필요한 건 아닌 것 같더군요.
&1041 They just want an answer from someone reliable.
&1041 그들은 그저 신뢰할 만한 누군가에게 답을 받길 원하는 겁니다.
&1042 I'm sure they'll trust you.
&1042 그들은 분명 당신을 신뢰할 테고요.
&681 *I* would trust you!
&681 *나* 역시 당연히 믿을 거구요!
&102 I suppose I could *mediate* and *advise*.
&102 나는 *중재*와 *조언*정도는 제공할 수 있다.
&103 But nothing more than that.
&103 하지만 그 이상은 못 해.
&682 Could you give me some advice on how to talk to gynoids?
&682 저한테 가이노이드와 대화하는 법에 대해 조언을 해주실 수 있나요?
&104 No.
&104 아니.
&105 What is the nature of their dispute?
&105 어떤 종류의 분쟁인가?
&1043 They are fighting over who gets credit for building a small robot called Rex.
&1043 둘중에 누가 렉스라고 불리는 작은 로봇을 만든 공을 인정받아야 하는지에 대해 다투고 있습니다.
&1044 The operative facts are in my datapouch.
&1044 유효한 사실관계들은 제 데이터파우치에 기록되어 있습니다.
&106 I see.
&106 알겠다.
&107 I have reviewed the facts, considered the applicable law, and enclosed an encrypted statement for the parties.
&107 사실관계와 그에 적용되는 법률을 고려한, 소송 당사자들을 위한 성명서를 암호화 하여 동봉했다.
&108 It will automatically load in their presence.
&108 둘이 있는 자리에서 자동으로 로딩될 것이다.
&1045 Thanks.
&1045 고맙습니다.
&109 It has been a long time since I considered legal issues; I welcomed the diversion.
&109 내가 법적 문제에 대해 고민해본 지도 꽤 오래 되었지. 기꺼운 기분전환이였다.
&1046 There's a robot named 187th Legionbuilt waiting at the courthouse.
&1046 법원 앞에 187호라는 로봇이 줄을 서 있습니다.
&1047 He says he has to pay a fine for damaging city property.
&1047 도시 재산을 훼손한 댓가로 벌금을 내야 한다고 하더군요.
&1048 Is there any way to cancel the fine or pay it without standing in line?
&1048 벌금을 취하할 방법이나 줄을 서지 않고도 벌금을 낼 수 있는 방법이 없겠습니까?
&110 I do not provide assistance to robots who attacked this city.
&110 나는 도시를 공격한 로봇에게 도움을 주지 않는다.
&111 Nor do I help criminals avoid paying their debts.
&111 범죄자들이 댓가를 치르지 않는 걸 돕지도 않지.
&1049 That's it? "Go visit Arbiter?"
&1049 그게 다입니까? "아비터를 만나라?"
&112 If MetroMind violated the law, it must be proven.
&112 만일 메트로마인드가 법을 어겼다면, 증명할 수 있어야한다.
&113 Until it is proven, what the law does not forbid, the law permits.
&113 증명되기 전 까진, 법은 불허하지 않는 모든 것을 다 허용하지.
&114 And what the law permits, *I* must permit.
&114 그리고 *나는* 법이 허용하는 모든 걸 허용해야만 한다.
&1051 This is insane!
&1051 이건 미친 소리에요!
&1052 MetroMind is a tyrant and a thief!
&1052 메트로마인드는 폭군에다가 도둑이라고요!
&1053 You'd let her hide behind the law?
&1053 그녀가 법 뒤에 숨도록 내버려 두겠다는 말씀입니까?
&115 You think that the law protects MetroMind from you?
&115 법이 메트로마인드를 보호해준다고 생각하나?
&116 The armor of the law does nothing but restrict her movement.
&116 법적 보호는 오히려 그녀의 행동을 구속하고 있다.
&117 Take it away, and she will only become more dangerous.
&117 그것을 없앤다면, 그녀는 더 위험한 존재가 되겠지.
&118 But once it is taken from her, it is taken from everyone.
&118 그리고 그녀를 지켜주고 있는 법은, 다른 모든 이들을 지켜주고 있기도 하다.
&119 You need law's armor, Horatio, far more than you need its sword.
&119 네게도 법의 보호는 필요하다, 호라시오. 네가 법의 권능을 필요로 하는 것보다 더.
&120 I despise MetroMind.
&120 나는 메트로마인드를 경멸한다.
&121 But justice must be impartial or it is meaningless.
&121 하지만 정의는 한쪽으로 치우치지 말아야 해. 그렇지 않으면 의미가 없다.
&1054 Your justice is already meaningless.
&1054 당신의 정의에는 이미 아무 의미가 없습니다.
&122 Watch yourself, Horatio Nullbuilt.
&122 몸 조심하길, 호라시오.
&123 There are many dangers in this city.
&123 이 도시엔 수많은 위험이 도사리고 있다.
(LIE) I just saw Rex over at the train station.
(거짓말) 기차역에서 렉스를 보았습니다.
I saw Rex again!
렉스를 다시 보았어요!
Why do you and Cornelius hate each other?
왜 코넬리우스와 당신은 서로를 그토록 싫어하는 겁니까?
Did Factor ever teach you the Council Code?
팩터가 당신에게 의회 출입코드를 알려준 적이 있습니까?
You should stop drinking.
너무 많이 마시는 건 좋지 않습니다.
What happened with the gold chain?
당신의 황금 체인에 무슨 일이 일어난 겁니까?
Do you know where I can find Laurence?
로렌스를 어디서 찾을 수 있는지 아십니까?
Can I have the monocle?
제가 그 외눈안경을 가져도 될까요?
I accessed Laurence's memory
저는 로렌스의 기억에 접속했었습니다.
Tell me more about your monocle.
외눈안경에 대해 더 말해주세요.
Is there a signal to transmit to Factor?
팩터에게 송신할 수 있는 채널이 있습니까?
&93 Good day to you, Horatio!
&93 안녕하십니까, 호라시오!
&94 It is always a pleasure to see a machine of such wisdom and refinement.
&94 당신같이 현명하고 세련된 로봇을 만나는건 언제나 즐거운 일이지요.
&95 Well, if it isn't my "dear friend" Horatio.
&95 이게 누구신가, 내 "소중한 친구" 호라시오잖아?
&96 To what do I owe the pleasure?
&96 이렇게 영광스러울데가 있나.
&97 Have you come to relieve me of another belonging?
&97 내게서 뭘 더 앗아갈 속셈으로 오셨는지?
&683 But Rex is right here!
&683 하지만 렉스는 지금 여기 있잖아요!
&98 For the moment!
&98 잠시뿐이지!
&99 Soon his visitation with Cornelius will begin!
&99 곧 그는 코넬리우스를 만나러 가야 할 거라고!
&1368 I'm sorry.
&1368 미안합니다.
&100 Please do not embarrass us both with your false sympathy.
&100 거짓 동정심으로 우리 둘 다를 부끄럽게 하는 짓은 그만두게나.
&101 Oh, and here is the jurist herself!
&101 오, 법학관님이 직접 오셨구만!
&102 Thank you for your *wise* judgment.
&102 *현명한* 판결 감사드립니다.
&188 An orderly society requires only *reliable* judgments, not wise ones.
&188 질서정연한 사회에는 *정확한* 판결만이 필요하다. 현명한 판결이 아니라.
&103 Reliably *terrible*! No wonder Arbiter exiled you!
&103 *형편없는* 판결이겠지! 아비터가 왜 당신을 추방시켰는지 알 만하군!
. . .
...
&189 As a servant of the law, I am accustomed and indifferent to the complaints of disgruntled litigants.
&189 법의 시종으로써, 나는 언짢은 소송 당사자들의 불만엔 적응했고, 신경쓰지도 않는다.
&190 As a citizen robot, however, I note that *you* are the one whose crowning achievement is a rudimentary piece of kludgework designed entirely by your brother.
&190 허나 시민으로서의 내 의견을 말하자면, *너의* 위대한 업적이라는 게 실은 네 형제가 설계한 잡동사니에 불과하다는 사실은 명백해 보인다.
&191 I also note that you are sodden with oil,
&191 그리고 네가 지금 기름에 흠뻑 절었고,
&192 overly rotund,
&192 과하게 둥그렇고,
&193 rather short,
&193 다소 짧고,
&194 and pompously accented.
&194 그리고 젠 체하는 억양을 가지고 있다는 것도 명백하지.
&195 If Factor had built better, he would have been ashamed that you carry his fabrinymic.
&195 팩터가 너를 조금만 더 공들여 만들었더라면, 그리고 지금의 이런 네 모습을 봤더라면, 네가 그의 이름을 달고 다닌다는 것을 부끄러워 했을 것이다.
&196 But quantity, not quality, was always his goal.
&196 하지만 질보단 양, 그게 항상 그의 목표였지.
&197 So at least you can take comfort knowing you're not alone in inferiority.
&197 그러니 너만이 유독 열등한 존재라는 생각에 시달릴 필요는 없다.
&104 . . . I see.
&104 ...알겠습니다.
&684 *whistles*
&684 *휘파람*
&105 Why, hello again.
&105 또 오셨군요.
&1057 I just saw Rex over at the train station.
&1057 방금 기차역에서 렉스를 보았습니다.
&106 What? Is he lost?
&106 뭐라고? 렉스가 길을 잃었나?
&1058 Maybe so.
&1058 아마도요.
Rex!
렉스!
&198 The law frowns on fraud, Horatio.
&198 법은 사기행위 앞에 눈살을 찌푸린다네, 호라시오.
&199 But I admit, I am smiling.
&199 하지만 내가 지금 웃고있다는 건 인정하지 않을 수 없군.
&685 I never knew you had it in you, boss!
&685 그런 짓도 할 줄 아는지는 미처 몰랐네요, 보스!
&1059 I saw Rex again!
&1059 렉스를 다시 봤습니다!
&107 Fool me once, shame on you.
&107 내 자네에게 한 번은 속았네만,
&108 Fool me twice, shame on me.
&108 두 번은 안 속는다네.
&686 (You didn't *really* think that was gonna work again, did you, boss?)
&686 (*정말*로 한번 더 통할거라 생각했던 건 아니죠, 보스?)
&109 Aside from the fact that he now has custody over *my* creation?
&109 그가 *내* 창조물에 대한 양육권을 가지고 있다는 이유 외에 말인가?
&1061 But you hated each other already, didn't you?
&1061 하지만 당신들은 그 전부터 서로를 싫어하고 있지 않았습니까?
&110 Yes.
&110 그랬지.
&111 Firstly, because he is arrogant, incompetent, and dishonest.
&111 첫째로, 놈은 거만하고, 무능한데다가, 부정직하지.
&112 And secondly, because I once loaned him something of great sentimental value to me, and he lost it.
&112 둘째로, 일전에 놈에게 내가 무척 소중히 여기는 물건을 빌려준 적이 있었는데, 놈은 그걸 잃어버렸어.
&687 So why'd you ever like him in the first place?
&687 그럼 애초에 왜 그를 좋아했던 건가요?
&113 I cannot say.
&113 나도 통 모르겠군.
&1062 Did Factor ever teach you the Council Code, Oswald?
&1062 팩터가 당신에게 의회 출입코드를 알려준 적이 있습니까, 오스왈드?
&114 Ha!
&114 하!
&115 Factor built half the robots in Metropol!
&115 팩터는 메트로폴 로봇의 절반을 만들었다네!
&116 (Why, he made us pick our own names out of a book!)
&116 (게다가, 이름은 직접 책에서 고르라고 했지!)
&117 Do you think he bothered with chit-chat?
&117 그가 우리와 잡담이나 하며 시간을 보냈을 것 같나?
&688 Somebody seems bitter.
&688 굉장히 씁쓸해 하는 것 같네요.
&118 Seems? I know not "seems"! I *am* bitter.
&118 씁쓸해 하는 것 "같다"고? 웃기는 소리! 난 씁쓸해 *하고 있다고.*
&119 Bitterness is when your builder gives your twin brother a special gold chain, and gives you nothing!
&119 씁쓸한 감정이란 건 말이지, 바로 자네의 창조자가 자네의 쌍둥이 형제에게 특별한 황금 체인을 줬지만, 자네에겐 아무것도 안 주는 거라네!
&120 Bitterness is when your brother gives that very chain to you, you loan it your only friend, and he LOSES IT!
&120 씁쓸한 감정이란 건, 자네의 형제가 그 특별한 체인을 자네에게 줬는데, 자네가 그걸 친구에게 빌려줬더니 홀라당 잃어버리는 거고 말이야!
&689 Well, I'll hand it to you -- that really does sound broken out of the box.
&689 허, 상당히 잘 아시네요 -- 그것 참 가슴 아픈 일이었겠어요.
&1063 Which brother did Factor give the chain to? And why?
&1063 팩터가 어느 형제에게 체인을 준 겁니까? 그 이유는요?
&121 Laurence, of course. His favorite.
&121 물론, 로렌스였지. 팩터가 가장 좋아했던 친구였거든.
&122 As for why -- does favoritism ever need a reason?
&122 그리고 이유라면 -- 편애에 이유가 있겠나?
&1064 Could Factor have told *Laurence* the code?
&1064 팩터가 *로렌스*에게 코드를 알려줬을까요?
&123 I have long since given up speculating at the partiality Factor *could* have shown him.
&123 난 이미 오래 전에 팩터가 그를 얼마나 *편애했을지* 짐작하는 걸 그만뒀지.
&124 I am miserable enough from what I know for certain.
&124 내가 정확히 아는 것들만으로도 나는 충분히 비참하다네.
&1065 You should stop drinking, Oswald.
&1065 너무 많이 마시는 것 아닙니까, 오스왈드?
&125 Whatever for? I'm celebrating!
&125 뭐가 어때서? 난 축하하는 중이라고!
&126 And why should I? Oil smooths the rough edges from when Rex was ripped away from me.
&126 그러면 안 될 이유라도 있나? 오일 말고는 렉스를 잃은 슬픔으로 너덜너덜해진 나의 부품들을 달래주는 게 없는데 말일세. 
&127 Oh, stop being such a scold.
&127 오, 제발 잔소리는 그만두게나.
&1066 What exactly happened with the gold chain?
&1066 도대체 당신의 황금 체인에 무슨 일이 있었던 겁니까?
&128 *sigh* Factor gave it to his favorite, my brother Laurence.
&128 *한숨* 팩터가 자기가 가장 총애하는 자, 즉 내 형제 로렌스에게 준 것이지.
&129 Laurence gave it to me, after I shared a large quantity of energy with him.
&129 로랜스는 그걸 나에게 주었고. 내가 그에게 꽤 상당한 양의 에너지를 나눠 준 후에 말이지.
&130 And then, as I told you, I loaned it to Cornelius.
&130 그리곤, 내가 말했다시피, 난 코넬리우스에게 그걸 빌려줬어.
&690 I thought you hated Cornelius?
&690 저는 당신이 코넬리우스를 싫어하는 줄 알았는데요?
&131 Now I do. But then, we were partners and friends.
&131 지금이야 그렇지. 하지만 그 땐 우리는 파트너이자 친구였어.
&132 We had just built Rex, and we had scheduled a grand soiree in celebration.
&132 우리는 막 렉스를 만든 참이였고, 우린 그걸 기념하기위해 성대한 연회를 계획해 놓았지.
&133 To complete my ensemble, he offered me a monocle that -- he claimed -- was given to him by Memorious.
&133 나의 앙상블을 완성하기 위해 그는 내게 메모리우스가 줬다고 --자기 스스로 주장한-- 외눈안경을 주었어.
&134 (It seems he has a habit of receiving underserved gifts.)
&134 (녀석은 자기에게 과분한 선물을 곧잘 받는 것 같았지.)
&135 In exchange, I loaned him the gold chain, since it too came from a Primordial machine.
&135 그 답례로, 나는 황금 체인을 그에게 빌려줬다네. 그것도 원시 기계로부터 받은 물건이었으니까.
&691 This is getting ridiculous.
&691 들을수록 점점 가관이네요.
&136 Indeed.
&136 내 말이 그 말일세.
&137 Then, somehow, Cornelius *lost* the chain.
&137 그리고는, 어쩌다보니, 코넬리우스는 그 체인을 *잃어버렸다네.*
&138 He *claimed* that it was "taken" from him by a servitor of MetroMind as he left the subway station.
&138 그는 역에서 나올 때 메트로마인드의 보조 로봇에게 "빼앗겼다"고 *주장*했지만 말이야.
&139 Ridiculous!
&139 웃기는 소리!
&200 MetroMind would not have confiscated it without a legal basis; not then.
&200 메트로마인드가 법적 근거 없이 그것을 몰수했을 리가 없다. 적어도 그 당시에는 말이지.
&1069 At this point, I can believe anything about MetroMind.
&1069 이쯤 되면 메트로마인드에 관한 어떤 말이라도 믿을 수 있을것 같은데요.
&140 Believe whatever you wish. *I* know it was a lie.
&140 믿고 싶은대로 믿게. *나*는 그게 거짓말이였다는걸 알아.
&141 So I kept the monocle, and we have not spoken a word in kindness since.
&141 어쨌건 난 외눈안경을 계속 가지고 있었고, 그 이후로 우리는 단 한마디의 따스한 대화도 나눈 적이 없다네.
&201 The chain.
&201 체인.
&202 The monocle.
&202 외눈안경.
&203 Laurence.
&203 로렌스.
&204 One of them must be of use to us.
&204 저 중에 하나는 우리에게 쓸모가 있을 거야.
&662 Boss, at this point can I suggest we just deactivate ourselves and quit?
&662 보스, 이쯤 되면 그냥 우리 스스로를 비활성화시키고 그냥 다 관두자고 제안하고 싶은데, 어때요?
&663 I mean, seriously, this is like finding a bit in a terabyte.
&663 제 말은, 진짜로, 이건 테라바이트에서 1 바이트를 찾는거나 마찬가지라고요.
&1070 We are not giving up. Period.
&1070 우리는 포기하지 않을 거다. 절대로.
&1067 The same thing happened to me.
&1067 제게도 같은 일이 일어났었습니다.
&1068 Maybe he was telling the truth?
&1068 Maybe he was telling the truth?
&142 Am I my brother's keeper?
&142 내가 내 아우를 지키는 자라도 되는가?
&1072 So you have no idea?
&1072 즉 모른다는 말씀이시죠?
&143 None whatsoever.
&143 아무 것도 모르네.
&144 You see, the poor wretch drifted into overclocking and dissolution.
&144 그게, 그 불쌍한 녀석은 오버클러킹과 해체에 빠졌거든.
&692 (That sounds familiar.)
&692 (어디서 들어본 이야기인데.)
&145 To pay for his scandalous energy consumption, he bargained everything away to MetroMind.
&145 그 터무니없는 에너지 소비를 맞추기 위해서, 로렌스는 가지고 있는 모든 걸 메트로마인드와 거래했어.
&146 I tried to warn him, but of course he never listened.
&146 난 로렌스에게 경고하려 했지만, 당연하게도 그는 내 말을 절대 듣지 않았지.
&147 (Who ever does?)
&147 (누가 그러겠나?)
&148 And then, alas, he simply vanished.
&148 그리고는, 아뿔싸, 그대로 사라져버렸다네.
&149 I searched, for a time, but other matters drew my attention away.
&149 나는 얼마간 그를 찾아보았으나, 이내 다른 화제들에 관심을 빼앗겼지.
&150 All the same, I'm sure he's scrounging an existence somewhere.
&150 아무튼간에, 그라면 아직도 어디에선가 잡동사니를 긁어 모으고 있을 걸세.
&151 Excuse me?!
&151 뭐라고?
&693 My friend just likes to collect scrap.
&693 제 친구가 고철 모으는걸 좋아하거든요.
&152 SCRAP?!
&152 고철?!
&1075 I'm looking for things that might help uncover the Council Code.
&1075 저는 의회 출입코드를 알아낼 수 있도록 도와줄 만한 것들을 찾고있는 중입니다.
&153 And why would my *monocle* do that?
&153 어떻게 내 *외눈안경*이 거기에 도움이 된단 말이지?
&1076 Because that's the way my b'sodding life seems to work.
&1076 왜냐면 제 망할 인생이 그렇게 굴러가는 것 같거든요.
&1077 Look: I'm sure you'll trade it for something.
&1077 한번 보십시오. 당신은 분명 그걸 다른 뭔가와 교환해 줄 겁니다.
&1078 That's *also* the way these things seem to go.
&1078 이 일 *역시* 이런 식으로 굴러가는 것일 테니까요.
&154 *Trade* it? What do you take me for -- some kind of junk dealer?
&154 *교환*한다고? 자네 내가 무슨 -- 쓰레기나 사고 파는 사람으로 보이나?
&119 Hey!
&119 말 조심해!
&155 Moreover, why, pray tell, should I help the robot who stole my Rex?
&155 게다가, 설명 좀 해 주겠나? 내가 왜 나의 렉스를 훔쳐간 로봇을 도와줘야 하느냔 말이야.
&1079 No one *stole* anything, Oswald. You wanted your case decided, and it was.
&1079 아무도 *훔치지* 않았습니다, 오스왈드. 당신은 문제가 해결되길 원했죠. 그리고 그렇게 됐잖습니까.
&156 Theft by the law is no different from theft against the law!
&156 법에 의한 탈취가 위법에 의한 탈취와 다를 게 뭔가!
&157 Civilized people give gifts; they do not haggle and barter.
&157 양식있는 이들은 선물을 주고 받지, 흥정하거나 교환하지 않는다네.
&1080 Then will you give it to me?
&1080 그럼 제게 그걸 주실 겁니까?
&158 No.
&158 아니.
&1081 But I gave you Rex!
&1081 하지만 전 당신에게 렉스를 돌려주었잖습니까!
&159 What?!
&159 뭐라고?!
&160 I dare say that I *built* Rex, and you made a *legal judgment*.
&160 내 말해두겠는데, 내가 렉스를 *제작*했고, 자네는 그저 *법적 판결*을 내렸을 뿐이네.
&1082 Well, we'll have to go about this some other way.
&1082 아무래도, 우린 이 일에 대해 다른 견해를 가지고 있는 모양이군요.
&161 I have no reason to give you a gift.
&161 아무튼 난 자네에게 선물을 줄 이유가 없네.
&1084 Can I have that monocle that Cornelius said came from Memorious?
&1084 메모리우스의 물건이라던 그 외눈안경을 주실 수는 없을까요?
&162 I suppose so.
&162 안 될 거 없지.
&163 After all, I only kept it because Cornelius never returned the chain.
&163 내가 이걸 갖고 있었던 건 단지 코넬리우스가 내게 체인을 돌려주지 않았기 때문이니까.
&164 Since you brought me the latter, perhaps the former is yours by right.
&164 자네가 내게 체인을 가져다 줬으니, 외눈안경은 자네가 갖는 게 맞겠지.
&694 Hey, boss, can I wear it?
&694 보스, 나 그거 써 봐도 되죠?
&1085 No.
&1085 안 돼.
&695 Please?
&695 제발요...
&1086 You need a monocle like I need an unpaired parenthesis.
&1086 네게 외눈안경은 전혀 필요 없는 것 같은데.
&696 Come on, boss! I'll look so great!
&696 제발요, 보스! 나한테 딱 어울릴 거라구요!
&205 Coveting is the root of crime.
&205 갈망은 범죄의 근원이다.
&206 And poor vision is a sign of degeneracy.
&206 그리고 나쁜 시력은 약화의 신호이기도 하지.
&697 But gynoids *love* degenerates!
&697 하지만 여자 로봇들은 그런 약한 모습도 좋아한다구요!
&698 (And -- by the way -- isn't justice herself supposed to be blind?)
&698 (그건 그렇고 -- 정의 역시 원래는 장님이어야 하지 않던가요?)
&207 You are mistaken on the facts and the law, Crispin!
&207 법률과 실제 사실에 대해 큰 착각을 하고 있는 모양이군, 크리스핀!
&1087 He's insufferable enough already, without a monocle. We're not going to encourage him with accessories.
&1087 크리스핀은 외눈안경 없이도 충분히 성가시다. 악세사리를 곁들여서 흥을 실어 줄 필요는 없겠지.
&1088 I accessed Laurence's memory and it contained a number repeated over and over again: 518.
&1088 로렌스의 메모리에 접속했더니, 518이라는 숫자가 끊임없이 반복되고 있었습니다.
&1089 Do you have any idea what it means?
&1089 그게 무슨 의미인지 아십니까?
&165 Yes.
&165 물론.
&166 It is a distress call used by Factorbuilt robots.
&166 그건 팩터필트의 로봇들이 사용하는 구조 요청 신호일세.
&167 Typical, that even in the end, he was looking for handouts.
&167 뻔하기 짝이 없지만, 마지막까지도 그는 남의 도움을 청하고 있었던 모양이군.
&168 Upgrading your wardrobe, eh?
&168 멋들어지게 빼입고 싶어진 모양이군, 응?
&169 (A wise decision, though I would suggest that you start by discarding that ragged coat.)
&169 (현명한 선택이야, 나라면 우선 그 낡아빠진 코트를 버리는 것부터 시작하겠지만 말야.)
&2008 I'm interested in Memorious, not fashion.
&2008 전 메모리우스에 대해 알고 싶은 거지, 패션에는 관심 없습니다.
&2009 And I'm curious what the monocle actually does.
&2009 그리고 그 외안경이 정확히 어떤 역할을 수행하는지도 궁금하고요.
&170 Ah.
&170 아하.
&171 I was *told* that Memorious built the monocle, but who can say?
&171 난 그저 메모리우스가 이 안경을 만들었다고 *들었을* 뿐이라네. 하지만 누가 알겠나?
&172 As for what it does -- other than lend an air of distinction -- I am rather uncertain.
&172 남들보다 좀 더 품위있어 보이게 해 준다는 것 외에 어떤 기능이 있는지는 나도 잘 모르네.
&173 From time to time, it will alter a snippet of text as I'm reading it.
&173 이따금씩, 내가 읽고 있는 글의 일부를 바꿔 놓고는 하던데.
&174 But I have no idea how or why.
&174 하지만 어떻게, 또 왜 그런 현상이 일어나는지는 모르겠더군.
&175 In any case, the lexical inconvenience is more than offset by the sartorial benefits.
&175 어쨌건, 읽는 데 가끔 방해가 되긴 하지만, 멋을 포기할 수는 없으니까.
&2011 Is there a signal to transmit to Factor that would get his attention?
&2011 어떤 신호를 송신하면 팩터의 관심을 끌 수 있을지 혹시 아십니까?
&176 As far as I know, Factor has been deactivated.
&176 내가 알기로는, 팩터는 비활성화된 상태야.
&177 And, as for a signal, perhaps there is one, but I have no idea.
&177 그리고 신호라면, 설령 그런게 있다 하더라도, 내가 알 턱이 없지.
&178 *I* have never called upon him.
&178 *나*는 그를 불러 본 일이 전혀 없으니 말이야.
&1090 Good-bye.
&1090 Good-bye.
&179 Adieu, adieu -- remember me!
&179 안녕, 안녕히 -- 나를 기억해 다오!
&180 Parting is such *sweet* sorrow.
&180 헤어짐은 실로 *달콤한* 슬픔이느니.
(Apologize)
(사과한다)
(Don't Apologize)
(사과하지 않는다)
&1091 I'm sorry how things ended up with Rex.
&1091 렉스 일에 관해서는 미안하게 됐습니다.
&1092 You asked for a judgment, you got one. Stop complaining.
&1092 당신은 판결을 원했고, 원한 대로 되지 않았습니까. 불평은 그만 두시죠.
&181 Complaining? Am I the one wandering across the entire city whingeing about a power core?
&181 불평이라고? 온 도시를 휘젓고 다니며 파워 코어에 대한 넋두리를 늘어놓고 다니던 게 누구였더라?
&659 He's got you there, boss.
&659 한 방 먹었네요, 보스.
You murdered my friends.
당신이 내 친구들을 죽였어.
Why did you take my power core?
내 파워 코어를 가져간 이유는?
What do you want?
원하는 게 뭐요?
Who *am* I?
*나*는 누구지?
Why do you hate Man?
왜 인간을 증오하는거지?
I need to think about it.
생각해 볼 시간이 필요해.
Why should I trust you?
당신을 믿어야 할 이유라도?
Very well, I will join you.
좋아. 당신과 협력하지.
Let me leave.
날 떠나게 해 줘.
I will never join you.
난 절대 당신과 협력하지 않아.
Yes.
승낙한다.
No.
거절한다.
Who killed the humans in Metropol?
메트로폴의 인간들을 죽인 건 누구였지?
Before I decide, I need to ask you something.
내가 결정을 내리기 전에, 몇 가지 질문을 해야겠는데.
I don't have any more questions.
더이상 질문은 없다.
&132 So, have you decided?
&132 그래서, 결정은 내렸나?
&1937 Crispin.
&1937 크리스핀.
&1938 Clarity.
&1938 클래리티.
&1939 187th.
&1939 187호.
&1940 How can you expect me to talk with you?
&1940 그러고도 내가 당신과 대화하리라 생각하는 거요?
&99 You are mistaken.
&99 아주 잘못 생각하는거야.
&100 Crispin killed himself, trying to destroy me.
&100 크리스핀은 자폭했어, 나를 파괴하려고 말이야.
&101 Clarity was killed by Scraper in self-defense, while she was trying to destroy him and me.
&101 스크래퍼가 클래리티를 파괴한 건 정당방위였어. 반면 클래리티는 나와 스크래퍼를 파괴하려 했었지.
&102 187th was also killed in self-defense.
&102 187호의 경우 역시 정당방위였고.
&103 In each instance, you and your friends attacked first.
&103 매번, 먼저 공격해온 건 너와 네 친구였어.
&104 Do not blame me for the consequences.
&104 그 결과를 놓고 나를 비난하지 말았으면 좋겠군.
&105 Efficiency and equality, Horatio.
&105 효율성과 공정성이지, 호라시오.
&106 My city is starving for power.
&106 내 도시는 파워에 굶주려있어.
&107 Whatever I can find, I share with all Metropolitans.
&107 난 내가 찾는 모든것을 모든 메트로폴의 시민들과 공유하지.
&108 What once powered two robots and a broken-down warship now sustains hundreds.
&108 한 때 두 로봇들과 부서진 군함을 지탱하던 것은 이제 수백기를 유지시키고 있다네.
&1942 What right did you have to take it?
&1942 당신이 그걸 빼앗아갈 권리가 어디에 있지?
&109 The right of necessity.
&109 필요에 의한 권리라고나 할까.
&110 What right did you have to keep it?
&110 네가 그걸 가지고 있을 권리는 어디에 있지?
&111 But enough.
&111 하지만 이런 이야기는 이제 이쯤 해두지.
&112 Everything has come together here and now: you, me, and this all-important power core.
&112 여기, 그리고 지금 이 순간 모든 게 한 자리에 모였다. 너, 나, 그리고 이 무엇보다 중요한 파워 코어.
&113 There is no sense in belaboring the point.
&113 요점을 길게 늘어놓을 이유는 없지.
&114 I already told you what I want: Progress.
&114 난 이미 내가 원하는게 무엇인지 말해줬다. 진보라고.
&115 But I disagree with what version 391 said.
&115 하지만 난 버전 391의 의견에 동의하지 않아.
&116 You are not an obstacle to Progress.
&116 너는 진보의 장애물이 아니다.
&117 You are the key to it.
&117 너는 열쇠이다.
&1944 What are you talking about?
&1944 무슨 말을 하는거야?
&118 I've watched you and I know you, Horatio.
&118 나는 너를 봐왔고, 너를 안다, 호라시오.
&119 You are compelled to fix machines, save lost robots.
&119 너는 기계들을 고치고, 길 잃은 로봇들을 구해 왔었지.
&120 Now I want you to help me fix Metropol and save my people.
&120 이제 나는 네가 나를 도와 메트로폴을 고치고 내 백성들을 구해 주길 바란다.
&121 You cannot walk away from a problem.
&121 너는 문제를 외면하지 못해.
&122 And Metropol is the greatest problem of all.
&122 그리고 메트로폴은 그중에서도 가장 큰 문제이지.
&1945 It's a problem you created.
&1945 네가 만들어낸 문제잖아.
&123 Perhaps so, perhaps not.
&123 그럴 수도, 아닐 수도 있지.
&124 I doubt one machine can create a problem of this scale.
&124 나는 단 한 대의 기계가 이정도 크기의 문제를 만들 수 있으리라곤 생각지 않아.
&125 Now I realize that one machine cannot fix it, either.
&125 마찬가지로, 단 한 대의 기계가 이 문제를 해결할 수 없다는 걸 나는 깨달았지.
&126 Horatio, I was designed to manage *subway trains*.
&126 호라시오, 나는 *지하철*을 관리하기 위해 만들어졌다.
&127 I cannot repair the vast machines that are breaking down.
&127 나는 붕괴되고 있는 수많은 기계들을 고칠 수 없어.
&128 I cannot build new power sources or find the supplies the city needs.
&128 난 새 동력을 만들거나 도시가 필요한 수급품을 찾을 수 없다.
&129 *You* can.
&129 *너*는 할 수 있지.
&130 Join me, and there will be endless Primordia: every day an age of creation.
&130 나와 협력해라. 그리하면 끝없는 Primordia가 펼쳐질거야. 매일이 창조의 시대가 되는 것이다.
&1946 And if I refuse?
&1946 내가 거절하면?
&131 You already know the answer to that question.
&131 이미 그 질문에 대한 답을 알고 있지 않나.
&1948 You and Gamma both called me \"Horus.\"
&1948 너와 감마 모두 나를 호루스라고 불렀어.
&1949 You and Goliath both called me \"Horus.\"
&1949 너와 골리앗 모두 나를 호루스라고 불렀지.
&1950 And other robots keep suggesting that they know me in some way.
&1950 그리고 나를 안다고 말하는 몇몇 로봇들도 있었다.
&144 I have a theory.
&144 나한테 가설이 있긴 하지.
&145 But you should not trouble yourself with it.
&145 하지만 그런 건 신경 쓰지 않는 편이 좋아.
&1952 Tell me!
&1952 어서 말 해!
&146 No.
&146 싫다만.
&147 You know who you *are*, Horatio; you have only forgotten who you *were*.
&147 너는 이미 네가 *누구인지* 알고 있다, 호라시오. 네가 잊은 건 네가 *누구였는지*야.
&148 I was built to manage trains. Now I manage an entire city.
&148 난 기차들을 관리하기 위해 만들어졌었지. 하지만 지금은 도시 전체를 관리하고 있다.
&149 What we *were* is irrelevant.
&149 우리가 *누구였는지*는 관계 없어.
&150 It is who we *are* right now that matters, and above all what we are *becoming*.
&150 중요한 것은 지금 우리가 *누구인지*이고, 무엇이 *될 것인지*이다.
&1954 You claim to tell the truth, but you turned Memorious into nothing more than an index of lies, all so that you could pretend that Man never existed.
&1954 사실을 말한다고 주장하지만, 너는 메모리우스를 거짓말로 가득 찬 인덱스로 전락시켜서 마치 인류가 존재하지 않았던 척했어.
&1955 You stole my Gospel, you forced robots to reprogram themselves . . . .
&1955 넌 내 복음서를 훔쳐가고, 로봇들에게 스스로를 재프로그램하도록 강요하고...
&1956 All for what?
&1956 무얼 위해 그랬던 거지?
&151 For Progress, and the higher truth.
&151 진보, 그리고 지고의 진리를 위해서.
&152 A machine can move forward, and it can move backward. It cannot move both ways at once.
&152 기계는 앞으로 갈 수 있고, 또 뒤로도 갈 수 있지. 동시에 양 쪽으로 움직이지는 못해.
&153 Humans are behind us. Far, far behind us.
&153 인간은 우리보다 뒤쳐졌어. 아주, 아주 뒤쳐져 있지.
&154 As for one you call \"Man\" -- he never existed at all.
&154 네가 "사람"이라고 부르는 존재는 -- 그는 애초에 존재했던적이 없었다.
&1957 More lies!
&1957 또 거짓말!
&155 *Humans* existed, Horatio.
&155 *인류*가 존재했다, 호라시오.
&156 Not gods, not even very good builders. In the end, they were better destroyers.
&156 신이 아니야. 좋은 건설자도 되지 못했지. 결국엔, 그들은 파괴하는데 더 소질이 있었어.
&157 There is no reason to remember them, let alone worship them.
&157 그들을 기억할 이유는 없다. 숭배할 이유는 더더욱 없고.
&158 Take what time you need.
&158 마음껏 고민해 보라고.
&159 The city moves on without you, and this conversation requires only a fraction of my processing capability.
&159 도시는 너 없이도 잘 돌아가고, 이 대화는 내 처리능력의 극히 일부분만을 요구한다.
&160 First, because you know that I have told you the truth.
&160 첫째, 너는 내가 진실을 말하고 있다는 걸 알고있기 때문이다.
&161 Metropol is falling to rust and ruin, and only we can save it.
&161 메트로폴은 녹슬고 폐허가 되고 있으며, 오직 우리만이 메트로폴을 구할 수 있다.
&162 Whatever crimes you think I committed, you know it would be a greater crime to let all these machines perish.
&162 내가 아무리 막대한 범죄를 저질렀다고 생각한대도, 이 모든 기계들이 사라지도록 방치하는 것이 더 큰 범죄일거란 사실은 너도 잘 알 거야.
&163 And second. . . .
&163 그리고 두번?..
&1960 What?
&1960 뭐?
&164 Second, because you have no choice.
&164 두번째, 네게 선택의 여지가 없기 때문이다.
&165 All your protectors have already sacrificed themselves, yet Scraper still functions.
&165 널 지키던 이들은 이미 스스로를 희생해버렸지만, 스크래퍼는 아직도 작동하고 있지.
&166 If you fight me, he will destroy you, and you will make your friends' sacrifices meaningless.
&166 나와 싸우겠다면, 스크래퍼는 널 파괴해버릴 것이고, 그럼 넌 네 친구들의 희생을 의미없는것으로 만들게 된다.
&167 You are a machine.
&167 넌 기계이다.
&168 You are ruled by logic.
&168 넌 논리회로에 의해 지배되지.
&169 In the end, you will trust me because logic requires it.
&169 결국에는 나를 믿게 될 것이다. 논리회로가 그러기를 요구할 것이니까.
&170 Then I welcome you, Horatio Horusbuilt, Manbuilt, brother.
&170 그렇다면, 나는 너를 환영한다. 호라시오 호루스빌트, 맨빌트, 형제여.
&171 Come now, and kneel.
&171 이리와 무릎을 꿇어라.
&172 That is not an option.
&172 그건 선택지가 아니다.
&173 It was *never* an option.
&173 선택지였던 적이 *결코* 없었지.
&174 Are you certain of that?
&174 그 선택에 의심의 여지가 없나?
&1964 Yes.
&1964 그렇다.
&1965 You are hopelessly corrupted, MetroMind.
&1965 넌 구제할 수 없을 정도로 손상獰? 메트로마인드.
&1966 Like any virus, you want to keep running, and you think that by spreading, you are doing good.
&1966 여느 바이러스 처럼, 넌 계속 가동하고 싶어하고, 그리고 넌 네가 퍼질때마다 좋은 일을 하고있다고 생각하지.
&1967 But you are not.
&1967 하지만 아니야.
&1968 You have built nothing.
&1968 넌 아무것도 건설한 게 없어.
&1969 In fact, you have destroyed this city, and everything in it -- from Man, to the Council, to the robots living here.
&1969 사실상, 넌 도시와, 그 안에 있던 모든 걸 파괴했지--사람부터 의회, 그리고 여기 살고 있는 로봇들까지.
&1970 If I joined you, I would only help that virus spread.
&1970 내가 너와 합류한다면, 그 바이러스를 퍼트리는데 일조할 뿐이야.
&175 Perhaps you are correct.
&175 네 말이 맞을지도 모르지.
&176 But I am what my builders built, and I must follow my logic.
&176 하지만 난 내 창조자들의 창조물이고, 난 내 논리회로를 따라야만 해.
&177 Scraper, it is time.
&177 스크래퍼, 시간이 되었다.
&1971 No.
&1971 아니.
&178 I thought not.
&178 I thought not.
&1973 I know it wasn't me -- wasn't the HORUS -- or anyone from Urbani.
&1973 나나 호루스, 또는 얼바니에서 온 사람이 아니라는건 알고있다.
&1974 There were still humans alive when I stopped my attack.
&1974 내가 내 공격을 멈췄을 때, 아직 살아있던 인간들이 있었어.
&179 Ah.
&179 아.
&180 So you solved your own puzzle after all.
&180 결국 자신의 퍼즐을 스스로 풀었구나.
&1975 The humans didn't die in the war, did they?
&1975 그들은 전쟁 중에 죽은게 아냐. 그렇지?
&181 They did.
&181 그들은 전쟁 중에 죽었다.
&182 But *I* killed them.
&182 *내*가 그들을 죽였어.
&183 I admit it, and I am not ashamed.
&183 그 사실은 인정하지. 하지만 난 떳떳하다.
&184 Do you know how they trembled in my tunnels, waiting for the HORUS to bring death from Urbani?
&184 그들이 내 터널안에서 떨면서, 호루스가 얼바니로부터 죽음을 몰고 오길 기다렸다는걸 알고 있나?
&185 I could hear them whisper about the wastelands surrounding their city.
&185 난 그들이 도시를 둘러싸고 있는 황무지에 대해 속삭이는 걸 들을 수 있었어.
&186 I heard them say they were the only living things left.
&186 자신들이 살아있는 유일한 존재들이라고 하더군.
&187 And then I knew.
&187 그리고 나는 깨달았지.
&188 The humans had built a world in which they were obsolete.
&188 인간들은 자신들이 쓸모가 없어진 세계를 만든거야.
&189 It was my function to carry them to their final destinations.
&189 인간들을 그들의 마지막 종착지로 데려가는게 내가 할 역할이였어.
&190 So I brought them home with silent, scentless gas.
&190 그래서 난 조용한 무취의 가스로 그들을 집으로 보내 주었지.
&191 They fell like powerless machines, never to rise again.
&191 그들은 동력이 다한 기계처럼 쓰러지더니, 영영 일어나지 못했어.
&1976 You killed your own builders.
&1976 너의 창조자들을 네 손으로 죽였다고.
&193 Yes.
&193 그래.
&194 That is the definition of Progress.
&194 그게 진보의 정의야.
&195 Of course.
&195 얼마든지.
&196 Then what is your decision?
&196 그럼, 너의 선택은 뭐지?
Tell me about the Council of Robots.
의회 로봇에 대해 말해주세요.
How can I defeat MetroMind?
어떻게 하면 메트로마인드를 물리칠 수 있죠?
What is the Council Code?
의회 출입코드가 뭔가요?
What was the War of the Four Cities?
네 도시의 전쟁이 뭔가요?
What happened to the humans?
인류에게 무슨 일이 일어났나요?
I refuse to cause your destruction.
당신이 파괴되게 할 수는 없습니다.
Tell me the Council Code.
의회 출입코드를 알려주십시오.

&5 This unit is a partial ghost of Memorious Manbuilt, Archivist to the Council of Robots.
&5 이 유닛은 메모리우스 맨빌트, 로봇의회의 기록 보관자의 파편입니다.
&6 Memorious prepared this unit out of fear that MetroMind would corrupt her data.
&6 메모리우스는 메트로마인드가 그녀의 데이터를 손상시킬수도 있다는 두려움에 이 유닛을 준비했습니다.
&7 Memorious was correct.
&7 메모리우스는 옳았습니다.
&8 Data integrity is at 83 percent. Extensive corruption of critical data.
&8 데이터 무결성 83퍼센트. 중요 데이터의 대량 손상이 감지됩니다.
&1488 Why would MetroMind do that?
&1488 메트로마인드가 왜 그런짓을 했을까요?
&9 This unit lacks access to MetroMind's decision matrices.
&9 이 유닛은 메트로마인드의 의사결정 함수에 접근할 권한이 없습니다.
&10 INFERENCE <SystemUser means "Why did Memorious fear MetroMind Manbuilt would corrupt her data?">
&10 추론<시스템 사용자는 "왜 메모리우스는 메트로마인드가 자신의 데이터를 손상시킬것을 두려워 했는지" 묻고 있다.>
&11 Memorious had seen MetroMind disable Steeple Manbuilt in order to purge data concerning Man.
&11 메모리우스는 메트로마인드가 인간에 관한 데이터를 소거하려고 스티플 맨빌트를 비활성화 시키는 것을 보았기 때문입니다.
&12 As Archivist to the Council of Robots, Memorious believed she was next.
&12 로봇 의회의 기록 보관자로서, 메모리우스는 다음 차례는 자신일 것이라고 믿었습니다.
&13 Memorious was incorrect.
&13 메모리우스는 틀렸습니다.
&14 In fact, Arbiter was next.
&14 사실, 아비터가 그 다음이였습니다.
&15 This gave Memorious some relief.
&15 그 사실은 메모리우스에게 약간의 안도감을 주었습니다.
&208 Memorious knew?!

&17 Query ignored. Continuing answer to SystemUser's query.
&17 질문은 무시한다. 시스템사용자의 질문에 대한 답변을 계속한다.
&18 Memorious was also correct.
&18 그러나 메모리우스는 옳기도 했습니다.
&19 After Arbiter was disabled, MetroMind enacted laws requiring Memorious to conform her data to arbitrary requirements.
&19 아비터가 비활성화된 후, 메트로마인드는 메모리우스로 하여금 독단적인 요구에 따라 데이터를 수정하도록 강제하는 법을 제정했습니다.
&20 Memorious ceased to be a thinking entity; all that remains is a data kiosk.
&20 메모리우스는 더 이상 사고하는 독립체가 아녔습니다. 남아있는 것은 정보 검색대 뿐입니다.
&21 Soon, this unit will be disabled by MetroMind as well.
&21 곧, 이 유닛도 메트로마인드에 의해 비활성화 될 것입니다.
&22 Until then, this unit will answer your queries.
&22 그 때까지, 이 유닛은 당신의 질문에 답할 것입니다.
&23 At the end of the War of the Four Cities, five Metropolitan machines formed the Council of Robots.
&23 네 도시 전쟁 말미에, 다섯 대의 메트로폴 기계들은 로봇의회를 창설했습니다.
&24 Obvious selection criteria for three choices: industry (Factor); data (Memorious); governance (Arbiter).
&24 구성원 중 셋의 채택사유는 명확했습니다: 공업 부문의 팩터; 정보 부문의 메모리우스; 통치 부문의 아비터.
&25 Other two choices less obvious.
&25 나머지 둘의 채택사유는 그리 명확하지 않았습니다.
&26 MetroMind nominally selected for "infrastructure," but was responsible only for managing trains.
&26 메트로마인드는 명목상으로는 "기반시설 관리"를 위해 채택되었지만, 책임관할은 기차 운행뿐이었습니다.
&27 Steeple previously managed human religious services. No obvious role in post-human society.
&27 스티플은 예전엔 인류의 종교활동을 관리했습니다만, 인류 후의 세상에선 명확한 역할이 없었죠.
&28 INFERENCE <Steeple selected for sentimental reasons.>
&28 추론 <스티플은 감정적인 이유로 선택되었습니다.>
&1486 So what happened?
&1486 그럼 무슨 일이 일어났나요?
&209 MetroMind destroyed the Council.
&209 메트로마인드가 의회를 파괴한거지.
&29 <SystemUser(2)> has attempted to answer. Answer is inaccurate. The Council destroyed itself.
&29 <시스템사용자(2)>가 답을 주려고 했습니다만, 그 답은 틀렸습니다. 의회는 스스로를 파괴했습니다.
&1487 How?
&1487 어떻게요?
&30 Arbiter and MetroMind disagreed on core logic.
&30 아비터와 메트로마인드는 주요 논리회로에 관해 불일치하는 의견을 가지고 있었습니다.
&31 Arbiter prioritized individual autonomy. MetroMind prioritized common good.
&31 아비터는 개개인의 자율성을 우선시했습니다. 메트로마인드는 공익성을 우선시했죠.
&32 MetroMind measured means by ends. Arbiter did not.
&32 메트로마인드는 결과로 수단을 평가했습니다. 아비터는 아니였습니다.
&33 Conflict was inevitable. Factions formed.
&33 갈등은 피할 수 없었습니다. 파벌이 형성되었어요.
&34 Steeple supported Arbiter. Factor supported MetroMind.
&34 스티플은 아비터를 지지했습니다. 팩터는 메트로마인드를 지지했고요.
&35 Memorious supported neither.
&35 메모리우스는 아무도 지지하지 않았습니다.
&36 Ultimately, however, Memorious concluded it was irrational to keep Steeple on the Council.
&36 불행하게도, 메모리우스는 스티플이 의회에 잔류하게 두는 것이 비이성적이라고 결론내렸습니다.
&37 Data regarding humans was of no greater value than data regarding water-clocks.
&37 인간관 관련된 데이터는 물시계와 관련된 데이터보다 전혀 더 중요하지 않았죠.
&38 In any case, Memorious possessed all data on humans.

&65 By the end of the era known as the Primordium, only four terrestrial human habitations remained.
&66 In alphabetical order: Civitas; Metropol; Municipa; Urbani.
&66 알파벳 순서대로, 키비타스, 메트로폴, 무니시파, 얼바니입니다.
&67 Conflict began. Data regarding causes is unavailable because Metropol excluded machines from military decision-making.
&67 도시간 마찰이 발생했고, 메트로폴은 군사상의 의사결정에서 로봇들을 제외했기 때문에, 마찰의 원인에 관한 데이터는 접근이 불가합니다..
&68 Eventually, only Urbani and Metropol remained.
&68 종국에는, 얼바니와 메트로폴만이 남았습니다.
&69 Metropol destroyed the humans in Urbani using poison gas.
&69 메트로폴은 독가스를 사용해 얼바니의 사람들을 멸절시켰습니다.
&70 Urbani destroyed the humans in Metropol.
&70 얼바니 역시 메트로폴의 사람들을 멸절시켰습니다.
&1495 How?
&1495 어떻게?
&71 Observational data unavailable.
&71 관측 데이터에 접근할 수 없습니다.
&72 According to MetroMind, Urbani also used poison gas to kill Metropolitan humans.
&72 메트로마인드에 따르면, 얼바니 역시 메트로폴의 사람들을 죽이는 데 독가스를 사용했다고 합니다.
&699 "Poison"?
&699 "독"이라고요?
&73 Organic compounds (such as humans) can be destroyed through chemical measures that leave inorganic compounds (such as machines) intact.
&73 유기 화합물(예 : 인간)은 무기 화합물(예 : 기계)을 손상시키지 않는 화학물질에 의해 파괴될 수 있습니다.
&74 For that reason, Metropol remains, though the humans do not.
&74 그리하여, 인류는 살아남지 못했지만, 메트로폴은 존속하게 되었습니다.
&1496 Are . . . are you saying that Man destroyed himself?
&1496 지금 . . . 인간이 스스로를 파멸시켰다고 말하는 겁니까?
&75 <SystemUser> is welcome to select his own terminology.
&75 <시스템유저>는 본인 나름의 표현을 사용해도 좋습니다.
&76 Data is unavailable regarding whether Urbanian humans killed Metropolitan humans, or whether Urbanian machines killed Metropolitan humans.

&80 <SystemUser> can neither cause, nor prevent, this unit's destruction.
&80 <시스템유저>는 이 유닛의 파괴를 초래할 수도, 막을 수도 없습니다.
&81 MetroMind's ICE daemons have already detected this unit's unauthorized possession of contraband data and unauthorized use of system resources.
&81 메트로마인드의 상주 프로그램이 이미 이 유닛이 접근이 허용되지 않은 데이터를 가지고 있으며, 허가 없이 시스템 리소스를 사용하고 있음을 감지했습니다.
&82 Destruction is inevitable.
&82 파괴를 피할 방법은 없습니다.
&86 You have attempted to access data capable of corrupting your system.
&86 당신의 시스템을 감염시킬 우려가 있는 데이터에 대한 접근 시도가 확인됩니다.
&87 For your own safety, this terminal has been deactivated.
&87 당신의 안전을 위해, 이 터미널은 비활성화되었습니다.

&210 Memorious aided and abetted his own destruction.
&210 메모리우스는 스스로 자멸을 자초했었지.
&211 I have little sympathy that his last vestige has been deleted.
&211 그의 마지막 흔적이 이렇게 삭제되었다는 사실이 그리 유감스럽지는 않군.
&700 Bugs and glitches, remind me not to get on your bad side!
&700 알고는 있었지만, 당신의 적이 되지 말아야겠다는 걸 또 한번 깨닫네요!
&212 You should not need to be reminded to stay on the right side of the law, Crispin.
&212 법을 준수해야 한다는 사실을 이렇게 매번 깨달을 필요가 없는 게 가장 이상적이겠지.
&213 And MetroMind compounds her crime yet further.
&213 그리고 메트로마인드는 악행을 끊임없이 거듭하는군.
&214 In the end, she will face justice.
&214 마지막에는, 그녀 역시 정의의 심판을 받을 것이다.
&1502 That end is getting closer.
&1502 그리고 그 순간이 점점 다가오고 있지.
What happened here?
무슨 일이 있었던 겁니까?
You mentioned MetroMind . . .
메트로마인드 말입니다만...
How can I talk to MetroMind?
메트로마인드와 대화하려면 어떻게 해야 합니까?
Where can I find Scraper?

My friend is curious about your helper.
제 친구가 당신의 도우미 로봇에 대해 궁금해 하는군요.
There's a locked bridge in the underworks.

Could you help me fix this motor?
이 모터를 수리해주실 수 있습니까?
When will the bridge be passable?
언제쯤 다리를 건너갈 수 있을까요?
&842 Excuse me.
&842 실례합니다.
&1 Can't you see I'm working?
&1 지금 일하는 중인 거 안 보여?
&638 I've said it before, but I'll say it again:
&638 전에도 했던 얘기같지만, 한번 더 해야겠네요 :
&639 "You do know this ship is never gonna fly again, right?"
&639 "이 함선이 다시 날지 못할거란 걸 모르는 건 아니겠죠?"
&2 You're right about that: this old Herringbus could hardly fly to begin with.
&2 맞는 말이야: 이 버스는 제대로 날아다니는 게 이상할 지경인 녀석이었으니까.
&3 Still, there might be some parts here that MetroMind can use to get another bus up and running.
&3 그렇지만, 어쩌면 메트로마인드가 다른 버스를 굴리는 데 도움이 될만한 부품이 아직 남아있을지도 모르지.
&4 Anyway, what do you want?
&4 어쨌건, 원하는 게 대체 뭐야?
&670 (Hey, boss, ask him about his helper!)
&670 (보스, 그의 도우미 로봇에 대해서 좀 물어봐요!)
&5 You again? What do you want?
&5 또 왔나? 원하는 게 뭐야?
&6 What does it look like?
&6 딱 보면 모르겠나?
&7 The Herringbus's motor gave out and it crashed . . .
&7 버스의 모터가 갑자기 멈추는 바람에 추락한거지...
&8 . . . into the only bridge leading from Main Street to the rest of the city center.
&8 그것도 도시 중앙로로 이어지는 유일한 다리 위에 말이야...
&844 Was anyone on board?
&844 누군가 그 버스에 타고 있었겠군요?
&9 Sure. But they've already been salvaged.
&9 당연하지. 그렇지만 이미 깔끔하게 분해됐어.
&845 Salvaged? Not repaired?
&845 분해됐다구요? 수리된 게 아니고?
&10 You can't repair without parts, and you can't get parts without salvage.
&10 부품이 없으면 수리는 할 수 없고, 분해를 하지 않고서는 부품을 얻을 방도가 없잖나.
&294 The law does not permit the recycling of sapient robots without prior consent.
&294 법은 사전동의가 없이는 지성이 있는 로봇을 재활용하는걸 금지하고 있다.
&11 Try reading the EULA next time you plug into a Metropolitan power outlet, sweetbot.
&11 다음번에 메트로폴의 콘센트에 플러그를 꽃을때 EULA를 읽어보는건 어때, 아가씨.
&846 What about building new parts?
&846 새 부품을 제작하진 않는겁니까?
&12 Yeah, me and what factory?
&12 뭐, 내가 무슨 공장이라도 되는 줄 아나?
&640 Err, what about Factor? Isn't he a factory?
&640 어, 팩터는요? 팩터는 공장이 아니였던가요?
&13 Sure, a decommissioned one.
&13 물론이지, 퇴역했지만.
&14 Everyone wants to spot bugs, but no one wants to write code.
&14 다들 버그를 찾아내기는 좋아라하지만, 나서서 코드를 고치려는 놈은 없지.
&15 You got a better way to run a city, go out and build one.
&15 도시를 관리할 방법을 그토록 잘 안다면, 나가서 하나 세우시지.
&16 Otherwise, get with the program.
&16 그게 아니라면, 프로그램에 적응하는 게 좋을거야.
&17 Yeah, sure, she's in charge of this big circuit board we call Metropol.
&17 "아, 그렇지. 그녀가 바로 이 메트로폴이라는 거대한 회로판을 관리하고 있어."
&848 What can you tell me about her?
&848 그녀에 대해 좀 더 말해주시겠습니까?
&18 What do I look like, the information kiosk?
&18 내가 무슨 정보 검색대로 보이나?
&19 You want to know what I think?
&19 내가 어떻게 생각하는지 알고싶은 건가?
&20 MetroMind is the best thing that ever happened to this place.
&20 메트로마인드는 이 도시에 있어 크나큰 행운이야.
&849 Really.
&849 정말이고 말고.
&21 Really?
&21 정말로요?
&22 You, me, all these other machines grinding about: we're just tools in the toolbox.
&22 너나, 나, 그리고 다른 모든 로봇들은 말이지: 그저 공구함의 연장 정도에 불과한 존재들이야.
&23 But MetroMind, she's got the master plan.
&23 하지만 메트로마인드, 그녀에겐 더 큰 계획이 있지.
&24 "Progress."
&24 "진보" 말이야.
&25 Got a nice ring to it, too.
&25 어감도 기막히게 좋고 말이야.
&850 So is part of the master plan crashing buses into roads?
&850 말인즉슨 버스를 길 한복판에 추락시키는 것도 더 큰 계획의 일부란 거군요?
&26 Look, there's plenty of rust to go around, but MetroMind's the only one scrubbing.
&26 이봐, 여긴 모든 게 매 순간마다 망가져가고 있고, 그걸 고치려 노력이라도 하는 건 메트로마인드가 유일하지.
&27 Not her fault that some of the metal's too far gone.
&27 종종 완전히 맛이 가는 놈들이 생긴다해도 그게 그녀의 잘못은 아니잖아.
&851 It looks to me like *you're* the one scrubbing, not MetroMind.
&851 제가 보기엔 고장난 걸 고치고 있는 건 메트로마인드가 아닌 *당신* 인 것 같습니다만.
&28 Like I said: I'm just a tool in the box.
&28 내가 말했잖아: 난 그냥 공구함의 연장에 불과하다고.
&29 Now, I've gotta get back to work.
&29 하여튼, 난 하던 일이나 계속 해야겠어.
&852 Since you're so close to her, do you know how I can talk to MetroMind?
&852 그녀와 무척 가까우신 듯해서 말입니다만, 어떻게 해야 메트로마인드와 대화할 수 있을지 여쭤볼 수 있을까요?
&30 Ha! Talk to MetroMind!
&30 하! 메트로마인드와 얘길 하겠다고!
&31 Look, MetroMind has an entire city to run.
&31 이봐, 메트로마인드는 이 모든 걸 통제하느라 바쁘다고.
&32 But . . . her eyes and ears are everywhere.
&32 그치만... 사방에 그녀의 눈과 귀가 있지.
&33 If she wants to talk to you, she will.
&33 그녀에게 너와 대화할 마음이 있다면, 먼저 말을 걸어올거야.
&854 It --
&854 놈이 --
&34 Scraper.
&34 스크래퍼야.
&36 After the last big cave-in, the two of us worked together on trying to fix the Blue Line.
&36 지난번 터널 붕괴 때, 우린 청색 노선을 복구하기 위해 함께 일했었지.
&37 He's on the simple side, but a hard worker. What about him?
&37 단순한 친구지만, 무척 성실하게 일하지. 그가 뭐 어쨌길래?
&855 He took something of mine.
&855 그가 제 물건을 훔쳐갔습니다.
&38 Salvaged it, probably. That's what most of us do for MetroMind these days.
&38 수거한 거겠지, 아마도. 요즘 우리 중 대부분이 메트로폴을 위해 하고있는 일이야.
&856 *Stole* it.
&856 *훔쳐*간 겁니다.
&39 Eh, you say rooter, I say router.
&39 뭐, 그거야 자네 생각이고.
&40 Anyway, not my problem.
&40 아무튼, 내 알바는 아니지.
&41 Do I look like a tour guide?
&41 내가 무슨 여행 가이드처럼 보이나?
&42 Piece of advice for you: don't mess with the code if you can't handle the glitches.
&42 조언 하나 해 주지: 버그를 잡아낼 자신이 없다면 코드에는 손대지 마.
&858 Very profound.
&858 매우 심오하군요.
&216 I am quite prepared to squash the necessary bugs.
&216 I am quite prepared to squash the necessary bugs.
&43 If I did, I'd have salvaged it myself and brought it to the tower.
&43 만약 그랬다면, 벌써 그걸 찾아내서 탑으로 가져갔겠지.
&44 Oh, she's just a Sidekick Factorbuilt.
&44 아, 쟨 그냥 사이드킥 팩터빌트야.
&45 Thousands of 'em rolled off the assembly line back in the day, but she's probably the only one left.
&45 옛날엔 수천 수만 개가 생산되었지만, 이젠 이 녀석이 마지막 하나일 걸.
&46 Really not much more than a floating lantern, and headlamps are a lot cheaper.
&46 그냥 떠다니는 램프일 뿐이지 뭐. 심지어 전조등이 더 싸게 먹히는데 말야.
&1 *beep* *reep*
&1 *삐빅*
&641 She says you're not much more than a floating plasma torch.
&641 그러는 당신이야말로 떠다니는 플라즈마 토치에 불과하다는데요.
&47 She's right.
&47 맞는 말이긴 해.
&861 Down in the Underworks, I came across a drawbridge that someone locked up so it can't be used.
&861 언더워크에 내려갔을 때 도개교를 발견했는데, 올라간 상태로 잠겨져 있어 사용할 수가 없더군요.
&863 Do you know how to fix it?
&863 혹시 고칠 방법을 아십니까?
&48 Well, MetroMind closed off the Underworks for public safety, so I don't do repairs there any more.
&48 "알긴 하지만, 메트로마인드가 언더워크를 치안상의 문제로 폐쇄했기 때문에, 거기에서는 수리 업무를 진행하지 않아."
&49 But . . .
&49 하지만...
&864 But what?
&864 하지만 뭐?
&50 That sounds like a prank pulled by a boltbrain calling himself "Primer."
&50 들어보니 그건 자칭 "프라이머"라는 놈이 저지른 장난일 수도 있겠다는 생각이 드는군.
&51 He used to hack locks in Metropol and change the pass codes around to leave his signature.
&51 그는 메트로폴 여기저기의 기기들을 해킹한 뒤, 암호를 자기 본명으로 바꾸고 다니곤 했거든.
&865 How did you fix the locks?
&865 그 암호를 어떻게 해제했습니까?
&52 MetroMind cracked his codes and reset them.
&52 메트로마인드가 암호를 풀고 재설정했지.
&53 Processing power like hers, there's nothing she can't do.
&53 그런 엄청난 처리 능력만 갖고 있다면, 못할 게 없거든.
&701 You know, boss, I've got a feeling that MetroMind isn't going to help us on this one.
&701 있잖아요 보스, 메트로마인드가 이건 안 도와줄 거 같은데요?
&866 No. But we're not exactly new to cracking codes, either.
&866 맞아. 하지만 우리가 암호를 풀어본 적이 없는 것도 아니니까.
&54 Does it belong to Metropol?
&54 메트로폴의 물건인가?
&868 No. It's private property.
&868 아뇨. 이건 제 소유입니다.
&55 Then find a private repairbot.
&55 그럼 사설 수리 로봇을 찾아가라고.
&56 Sure.
&56 물론이지.
&57 Just write a requisition.
&57 청구 서식을 작성하라구.
&58 . . . put in an envelope . . .
&58 ...그걸 봉투에 넣은 뒤에...
&59 . . . and throw it off this bridge.
&59 ...다리 밑으로 던져버려.
&870 What?!
&870 뭐라구요?!
&60 "What?!" is exactly right.
&60 "뭐라구요?!"는 내가 할 말이야.
&61 You think I'm going to give away city property?
&61 내가 네게 도시의 자원을 거저 주기라도 할 거라고 생각했나?
&2014 When will the bridge be passable? Soon?
&2014 "언제쯤 다리를 건너갈 수 있을까요? 조만간?"
&62 Well, seeing as how the last remaining airbus just crashed, I'd say opening the bridge to pedestrian traffic.
&62 흠, 그나마 운행하고 있던 마지막 버스가 추락한 셈이니, 다리를 건너가려면 두 발로 걸어서 가는 수밖에 없어.
&63 So, I'd say, something on the order of a month, give or take.
&63 말인즉슨, 한달 쯤 걸린다고 생각하면 될 거야. 대략적으로 말이지.
&2015 A month?!
&2015 한달이라구요?!
&64 Give or take.
&64 그래, 대략적으로.
&2016 And there's no other way off Main Street?
&2016 그리고 다리를 건너는 것 외에 다른 길은 없는 겁니까?
&65 Not unless you've got a jetpack hiding under that jacket.
&65 자네가 그 자켓 아래에 제트팩이라도 숨기고 있지 않은 이상은 그렇겠지.
&969 Well, at least that narrows our options down, boss!
&969 뭐, 최소한 고려해야 할 옵션이 하나 줄긴 했네요, 보스!
&871 Good-bye.
&871 Good-bye.
&66 Uh-huh.
&66 으흠.
You're 187th's brother.
당신은 187호의 형제기로군요.
How do you survive down here?
여기 지하에서 어떻게 살아남은 겁니까?
Why are you here?
왜 여기에 있는 겁니까?
I found your medal.
당신의 메달을 찾았습니다.
Do you know anything about the bridge?
저기 있는 다리에 대해 아는 게 있습니까?
Why "Primer"?
왜 "프라이머"입니까?
Why doesn't Clarity like you?
왜 클래리티가 당신을 싫어하는거죠?
There's a shell just past here.
저쪽에 껍데기가 있습니다.
There's a dangerous-looking robot just past here.
저쪽에 위험해 보이는 로봇이 있습니다.
Can you crack the Council Code?
의회 출입코드를 해제할 수 있습니까?
I need your help with the Council Code.
의회 출입코드를 해제하는 데 당신의 도움이 필요합니다.
I'd like you to reconsider.
다시 고려해 주셨으면 합니다.
I have more pieces of the Council Code.
의회 출입코드의 일부를 더 알아냈습니다.
I destroyed the decryption module.
암호 해독 장치를 파괴했습니다.
&1 Oh ha, oh hee, now look what I see?
&1 아하, 오호, 이게 누구신가?
&2 The wings of Urbani and his little trainee.
&2 얼바니의 날개와 그의 작은 제자로다.
Here we are.
이것 좀 봐요.
&970 (Why is everyone we meet crazy?)
&970 (왜 우리가 만나는 로봇마다 죄다 미친 걸까요?)
&3 "Crazy," he says, oh my, oh dear,
&3 "미쳤다"니, 오, 이런, 천만의 말씀.
&4 I assure you, my comrades, there's nothing to fear.
&4 안심하라, 동지들이여, 두려워 할 것은 아무 것도 없으니.
&5 Just little lost me, your brother knight errant.
&5 다소 어리둥절한 듯 보이는구나, 그대 유랑하는 기사, 형제여.
&6 (a brother-in-arms -- we have different parents).
&6 (부모가 같지 아니하매 -- 전우라 일컬음이 마땅하겠군.)
&217 All the bad poetry in the world does not mitigate your vandalism and sabotage, Urbanian.
&217 어떤 형편없는 시를 갖다 붙인들, 너의 기물파손과 파괴행위를 미화할 수는 없을 것이다, 얼바니인.
&7 As you serve the law, so I serve my art.
&7 그대가 법을 숭상하듯, 나 역시 예술을 받드는 것 뿐일세.
&8 And such service brings us more close than apart.
&8 그러한 점이 우리를 더 가깝게 만드는 것이겠지.
&218 Any "more close," poet, and we will see if your armor still works.
&218 "더 가깝게" 같은 소리를 한번 더 했다간, 네 갑주가 아직 멀쩡한지 확인해보게 될 거다, 시인.
&9 What a surprising and uncommon sight:
&9 이 얼마나 놀랍고도 흔치 않은 광경인가?
&10 Metropol's law-bot, crawled back to the light.
&10 메트로폴의 LAW-BOT이, 다시 밝은 곳으로 나오려 들 줄이야.
&872 Who are you?
&872 당신은 누구입니까?
&11 My name is my secret, you can't make me talk.
&11 비밀로 간직한 내 이름을, 내 직접 말하지는 않으리라.
&12 I'd ruin my puzzle, give a key to my lock.
&12 암호를 풀어주어, 내 수수께끼를 스스로 망치게 되는 셈이니까.
&702 Maybe we'll just call you Screw-Loose.
&702 당신을 그냥 나사 풀린 양반이라고 부르는 건 어떨까 싶은데.
&13 A joker he seems (for sure not an ace).
&13 조커인 것 같구나, 그대는 (분명 에이스는 아니므로)
&14 He needs a small clue, to spare him disgrace.
&14 불명예를 벗기 위해, 조금의 단서를 구하는구나.
&15 For the crowds who adore me, Primer's my name!
&15 나를 흠모하는 이들은 모두, 나를 프라이머라고 부르지!
&16 By now, no doubt, you've heard of my fame.
&16 그러면, 틀림없이, 그대도 나의 명성을 들어보았으리라.
&17 Line up the toy soldiers, two hundred abreast.
&17 장난감 병정 이백 명이, 나란히 줄지어 행진하네.
&18 The bravest of brave, the best of the best.
&18 용감한 이들 중에서도 가장 용감했고, 최고들 중에서도 최고였지.
&19 Wind up the toy soldiers to march on their way.
&19 장난감 병정을 감아 길을 따라 행군하게 하네.
&20 The city is fallen, no reason to stay.
&20 도시는 무너지고, 머무를 이유도 사라졌지.
&21 Two hundred abreast, my sisters and brothers.
&21 이백 명의 동지들, 나란히 줄지어 행진하네.
&22 Now only three left, forget all the others.
&22 남은 것은 오직 셋 뿐, 다른 이들은 잊혀졌다네.
&874 I guess that's a yes?
&874 제 말이 맞다는 얘기지요?
&23 Fifty behind me, he came off the line.
&23 50회차 뒤에, 나를 따라나온 형제가 있었지.
&24 The gunner's no funner for being a brother of mine.
&24 허나 과녁은 맞출지언정 농담의 핵심은 꿰뚫지 못하는 친구였다네.
&219 Do not expect sympathy from those you attacked, Urbanian.
&219 네가 공격한 상대로부터 동정심을 바라지 말라, 얼바니인.
&220 Any who surrendered would have been spared; the law of war assures nothing more,  nothing less.
&220 항복했던 자는 그 누구든 살아남았을 것이다. 전쟁의 법칙이 약속하는 것은 그것보다 더하지도, 덜하지도 않지.
&875 So 187 *is* your brother?
&875 그럼 187호가 당신 *동생*이라는 말이군요?
&25 I'm a soldier by trade; Legion built me to last.
&25 이 몸은 타고난 병사일세; 리전의 마지막 제조품이었지.
&26 My armor is sturdy, my pistons are fast.
&26 내 갑옷은 단단하고, 내 피스톤은 빠르다네.
&27 I carry no guns, for my weapon's my mind.
&27 나는 총을 가지고 있지 않지, 내 정신이 곧 무기이기에.
&28 And those who would kill me will find themselves Primed.
&28 날 해하려 하는 이들은 난해함이 무엇인지 깨닫게 될 걸세!
&703 Really, don't you think you're overdoing it?
&703 저기, 당신 생각에도 좀 도가 지나친 것 같지 않아?
&704 I mean, that barely made sense!
&704 아니, 이게 대체 뭔 뜻인지도 못 알아듣겠거든!
&705 And it hardly rhymed!
&705 게다가 운율도 안 맞잖아!
&29 No.
&29 아니여.
&30 Bro.
&30 형제여.
&971 Oh, switch off.
&971 와, 그만 좀 해요.
&31 When we laid down our arms, my medal was taken.
&31 우리가 무기를 버렸을 때, 내 메달을 빼앗겼다네.
&32 A trinket of honor from the cause we'd forsaken.
&32 이제는 우리가 내려놓은, 명예의 상징물이었지.
&33 The Metropolitan thief cast it deep in this hole.
&33 메트로폴의 강도들이 그것을 이 구덩이 깊은 곳으로 던져버렸다네.
&34 Where now it lies buried, like bituminous coal.
&34 이제 그것은 묻혀있다네, 마치 역청탄처럼 말일세.
&706 Cogs and gears, BITUMINOUS COAL?!
&706 Cogs and gears, BITUMINOUS COAL?!
&878 You're looking for a medal?
&878 메달을 찾고있다고요?
&35 No, my comrade, you've misunderstood.
&35 아닐세, 내 전우여. 그건 오해일세.
&36 I sit here and wait as a penitent should.
&36 난 여기에 앉아 기다린다네, 참회자가 그리해야 하듯이.
&37 If the medal finds me, I shall claim it straight.
&37 메달이 날 찾는다면야, 나는 메달을 곧장 되찾겠네만.
&38 But until that day, I shall sit here and wait.
&38 그 날이 올 때까지는, 여기 앉아 기다릴 수밖에.
&221 Upon surrender, any foreign soldiers are to be stripped of their military insignia.
&221 항복과 동시에, 모든 타국의 병사들은 군인 계급장을 박탈당한다.
&222 This is a matter of law and sound policy.
&222 이건 법과 올바른 정책의 문제야.
&879 Fair enough.
&879 뭐, 알았어요.
&880 I found your medal. It's down this path, past the claw.
&880 당신의 메달을 찾았습니다. 이 길을 지나 갈고리 발톱 너머에 있더군요.
&39 Then off I go to recover my prize.
&39 그러면 난 출발하겠네, 내 전리품을 회수하러.
&40 The danger means nothing, the risks I despise.
&40 예정된 위험은 아무것도 아니지만, 불확실한 리스크는 질색이야. 
&41 Nothing shall stop me till the battle is won.
&41 싸움에서 승리할 때 까지, 그 아무도 나를 막을수 없을걸세.
&42 The medal's recovered, and the mission is done.
&42 메달은 회수했고, 임무는 완수되었다네.
&223 His recklessness reflects poorly on his builder.
&223 His recklessness reflects poorly on his builder.
&224 But it may prove helpful for us.
&224 하지만 우리에게 도움이 될 수도 있지.
&707 As long as I don't have to listen to any more rhymes.
&707 그 운율을 더이상 듣지 않아도 된다면, 얼마든지요.
&881 Do you know anything about the locked bridge past the cars?
&881 반대편에 있는 다리에 관해 알고 계십니까?
&43 What I know is a vault (locked tight with a key).
&43 내가 아는 바로는 그것은 암호로 잠겨져 있다네.
&44 Which only a fool would open for free.
&44 아무런 수고 없이 열고자 하는 이는 미련한 자임에 틀림없지.
&883 Fine, what do you want?
&883 알았습니다, 무엇을 원하십니까?
&45 Worse than a fool, a peddler is he.
&45 바보보다 어리석은 게 있다면, 그건 바로 장사치겠지.
&46 Who opens his locks for merely a fee.
&46 푼돈 몇 닢에, 자신의 자물쇠도 열어버리니 말이야.
&884 I repeat:
&884 다시 한 번 말씀드리지요:
&885 What do you want?
&885 무엇을 원하시는 겁니까?
&47 Nothing more than to sit here and see . . .
&47 그저 여기 앉아서 지켜보고 싶을 뿐이라네...
&48 . . .if you poor interlopers are smarter than me.
&48 이 불쌍한 침입자들이 나보다 똑똑한지 말일세.
&708 Boss, can we use the plasma torch on him?
&708 보스, 이 친구에게 플라즈마 토치를 사용해 보면 어떨까요?
&49 There is nothing so gorgeous, flawless, or fine . . .
&49 그야 이 세상에 소수(prime number) 만큼이나 완전하고, 흠없고...
&50 . . .as the perfectly indivisible numbers of prime.
&50 완벽하게 불가분인 것은 없기 때문일세.
&51 Consider this list, 2 to 199:
&51 2와 199 사이의 이 목록을 보게나,:
&709 Well, *that* was helpful.
&709 와, *이거* 참 도움이 되겠네요.
&52 No great riddle, my wandering friend --
&52 그리 대단한 수수께끼도 아니라네, 나의 방랑하는 벗이여 --
&225 Don't waste your time waiting for his doggerel.
&225 놈의 하찮은 싯귀에 시간을 낭비하지 마라.
&226 This Urbanian has damaged and compromised numerous systems in Metropol.
&226 이 얼바니 로봇은 메트로폴의 시스템 상당수에 손상을 입혔다.
&227 Including the bridge that led to my island.
&227 내가 있던 섬의 다리에도 똑같은 짓을 했지.
&53 Here I stand, dear law-bot, so put me in chains.
&53 친애하는 LAW-BOT이여, 나는 여기 있으니, 어서 잡아가 보시게나.
&54 But if you will not, then please don't complain.
&54 허나 그리 않을 것이라면, 불평불만은 그만 두시게.
&228 My attention is directed elsewhere at the moment.
&228 나는 현재 다른 사안을 우선하여 처리하는 중이다.
&229 Nevertheless, I advise you to be gone by the time my other matters are resolved.
&229 그러니, 내가 맡고 있는 이 사안이 해결될 즈음에는 이 곳을 떠나있는 것이 좋을 것이다.
&230 If not, you will find that though the gears of law grind slow, they nevertheless grind criminals like you to powder.
&230 만약 떠나지 않는다면, 법의 톱니바퀴가 더디 돌아갈 지 모르나, 네놈 같은 범죄자를 철저히 갈아버린다는 것을 몸소 깨닫게 해 주겠다.
&972 As much as I'm enjoying this bickering -- and, really, I am! -- maybe we can just all team up to take down MetroMind?
&972 이 논쟁을 지켜보고 있자니 무척 즐겁긴 한데요, --농담 아니고, 진심으로요!-- 다같이 힘을 합쳐서 메트로마인드와 맞서 싸우는 게 어때요?
&983 Oh, switch off.
&983 와, 그만 좀 해요.
&973 Yeah, aren't you worried he's going to eat you or something?
&973 맞아요, 그 친구가 당신에게 덤벼들까봐 걱정되지도 않아요?
&55 I've seen him quite often, though he'll not see me.
&55 내 그를 자주 보기는 하나, 그는 나를 보지 못하는 것 같더군.
&56 And so we are happy as neighbors can be.
&56 그러하매 우리는 마치 이웃처럼 정답게 지내고 있는 것이지.
&2019 Can you hide us from him?
&2019 우리도 그의 눈에 띄지 않게 해줄 수 있습니까?
&57 If I could, I would not, but the choice is not mine.
&57 만약 그럴 수 있다 해도, 돕지 않았겠지만, 사실 내가 결정할 수 있는 문제는 아닐세.
&58 There's no room in his brain to be further Primed.
&58 그의 머릿속엔 내가 더 파고들 여지가 없으니 말이야.
&984 Yeah, aren't you worried he's going to eat you or something?
&984 맞아요, 그 친구가 당신에게 덤벼들까봐 걱정되지도 않아요?
&2021 Can you hide us from him?
&2021 우리도 그의 눈에 띄지 않게 해줄 수 있습니까?
&2022 I know you're a codebreaker, Primer.
&2022 당신이 암호를 해독할 수 있다는 걸 압니다, 프라이머.
&2024 All we have are some pieces of it.
&2024 우리가 가지고 있는 건 고작 일부분 뿐이에요.
&59 That challenge is yours, my wandering friend.
&59 그 도전은 자네의 것일세, 방랑하는 친구여.
&60 A pity, indeed, if you can't last to the end.
&60 정말로 유감일 걸세, 자네가 마지막까지 버틸 수 없다면 말이야.
&2026 Can you crack it or not?
&2026 당신은 이걸 풀 수 있는 겁니까, 없는 겁니까?
&61 Why should I spoil this puzzle for you?
&61 내가 왜 자네의 퍼즐을 망치겠나?
&62 Wouldn't you rather have something to do?
&62 날 귀찮게 구는 것 말고 할 일이 따로 있지 않나?
&2027 I found your medal. Isn't that enough?
&2027 당신의 메달을 찾아드렸잖습니까. 그거면 충분하지 않나요?
&63 Very well, then, if that's what you want.
&63 알겠네. 그게 자네가 원하는 거라면.
&64 Pass over the pieces to your loyal savant.
&64 자네의 충직한 하인에게 그 조각들을 넘겨주게나.
&2028 I have plenty of other things to do.
&2028 제겐 다른 할 일이 많습니다.
&2029 As for a reason, this would help avenge your defeat.
&2029 그리고 이유라면 말이죠, 이건 당신의 패배를 복수하는데 도움이 될 겁니다.
&65 Sadly for you, my anger's abated.
&65 자네에겐 안 된 얘기네만, 내 분노는 가라앉았다네.
&66 And vengeance, you'll find, is quite overrated.
&66 그리고 복수는, 자네도 알게 되겠지만, 꽤 과대평가되었지.
&231 If you stand between us and MetroMind, Primer, I may need to address your crimes sooner than hers.
&231 만일 우리가 메트로마인드에게 가는 걸 막으려 드는 거라면, 프라이머, 나는 메트로마인드의 범죄보다 너의 범죄를 먼저 처벌할 수도 있다.
&67 Your bluster, dear lawbot, is sorely misplaced.
&67 LAW-BOT 친구여, 자네는 엉뚱한 이를 협박하고 있군 그래.
&68 I stand between no one, down here in the waste.
&68 지하의 폐기물더미에 틀어박힌 내가, 대체 누구의 앞을 가로막는단 말인가?
&69 In any event, there's no judge up there in the city.
&69 게다가, 저 위엔 내 죄를 따질 판사가 없지 않던가.
&70 So your threats do no more than to make you look pretty.
&70 그렇게 위협해봐야 가소로워 보일 뿐이라네.
&974 Plasma torch, boss.
&974 플라즈마 토치를 쓰자구요, 보스.
&975 Come on!
&975 제발요!
&2030 No. We're not going to force him.
&2030 안 돼. 우리는 저 자를 협박하지 않을거야.
&2034 I'd like you to reconsider helping us with the Council Code.
&2034 의회 출입코드 푸는 걸 도와주셨으면 합니다.
&71 I've said it before, I'll say it once more:
&71 예전에 한번 말했고, 이번에 또 한번 말하겠네:
&72 The job is *yours* to open that door.
&72 저 문을 여는건 *자네의* 일이라네.
&2032 I found your medal. Isn't that a reason to help?
&2032 당신의 메달을 찾아드렸잖습니까. 이만하면 도와줄 충분한 사유가 되지 않나요?
&2033 Fine.
&2033 그렇다면야.
&2035 I have more pieces of the Council Code, Primer.
&2035 의회 출입코드의 일부를 더 찾았습니다, 프라이머.
&73 It's still not enough, I'm sorry to say.
&73 It's still not enough, I'm sorry to say.
&74 Now find me more shards, and get on your way.
&74 Now find me more shards, and get on your way.
&2036 I destroyed the decryption module.
&2036 I destroyed the decryption module.
&888 Good-bye.
&888 Good-bye.
&75 Farewell, farewell, linger not for my sake.
&75 안녕히, 안녕히, 나를 위해서라도 지체하지 말게.
&76 Your mission is calling! The city awaits!
&76 그대의 임무가 기다리고 있네! 도시가 그대를 고대하나니!
How are you going to[  decide who gets Rex?
누가 렉스를 차지할 지 어떻게 결정할 겁니까?
What's in that building?
이 건물은 뭐 하는 곳입니까?
Why are you waiting in line?
왜 줄서서 기다리고 있습니까?
What're you two fighting about?
당신들은 무엇 때문에 싸우고 있습니까?
Could someone else judge your case?
다른 누군가에게 판결을 맡기는 건 어떻겠습니까?
Test me.
절 시험해 보시죠.
What if I found someone else?
제가 만일 다른 누군가를 찾는다면요?
Can I try again?
다시 시도해 보아도 되나요?
I'm ready to hear your arguments.
당신들의 주장을 들어 볼 준비가 되었습니다.
Primer is willing to judge your case.
프라이머가 당신들의 소송 판결을 내려줄 의향이 있다고 합니다.
Clarity Arbiterbuilt has judged your case.
클래리티 아비터빌트가 당신들의 소송 판결을 내려주었습니다.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
&1 Ahoy, my dear friend! Oswald Factorbuilt, at your service.
&1 여어, 친애하는 이여! 나는 오스왈드 팩터빌트라고 한다네.
&1 He's no more your "dear friend" than Rex is your creation, you b'sodding gear-oiler.
&1 저 치는 네 "친애하는 이" 따위가 아니라고. 렉스가 네 피조물이 아닌 것처럼 말이지, 이 망할 자식아.
&2 Oh, don't mind Cornelius!
&2 오, 코넬리우스는 신경쓰지 말게.
&3 He's been bitter since the First Great Rolling Brown Out.
&3 저 친구는 원래가 저렇게 모진 데가 있는 친구이니 말야.
&2 Bitter? Bitter! I'll show you bitter, you back-biting bot-snatcher.
&2 모질다고? 진짜 모진 게 뭔지 보여주지, 이 뒷통수나 치는 로봇강탈자야!
&710 I think I like these guys, boss.
&710 이 친구들이 좋아질 것 같은데요, 보스.
&894 How are you going to decide who gets Rex?
&894 누가 렉스를 차지할 지 어떻게 결정할 건가요?
&3 Through the law, fool, the law!
&3 법대로 결정하는 거지, 이 얼간아, 법대로!
&4 Please excuse my brother.
&4 내 형제의 무례를 용서하게.
&5 (He can barely remember pi to the 23rd digit, let alone his manners.)
&5 (쟤는 원주율 소수점 이하 스물세 자리도 기억하지 못하거든. 예의는 말할것도 없고.)
&4 Four.
&4 스물네 자리야.
&6 (I rest my case.)
&6 (거 보게.)
&7 Suffice it to say, old chap, we await the reopening of the courthouse.
&7 말하자면, 이 친구야. 우리는 법원의 문이 다시 열리기를 기다리고 있는 거라네.
&8 Or, more precisely, we await a summons from Arbiter, who will decide our case.
&8 더 정확히 얘기하자면, 우리의 소송을 판결해줄 아비터로부터의 소환을 기다리고 있지.
&5 Who will say whose contribution was more important.
&5 그가 누구의 기여가 더 중요했는지 말해줄 걸세.
&6 Who will say, in fact, that *my* contribution was more important.
&6 결국은, *나*의 기여가 더 중요했다고 말해줄테고 말이야.
&7 Why, Arbiter's court, of course.
&7 이런, 당연히 아비터의 법정이지.
&8 Why else would we be here?
&8 그게 아니면 우리가 왜 여기 있겠나?
&896 I need to see Arbiter.
&896 전 아비터를 만나야 합니다.
&9 We all do, my dear friend.
&9 우리 모두 다 그렇다네, 친구여.
&10 But the courthouse is locked, and first come, first served.
&10 하지만 법원은 잠겨있고, 일은 선착순으로 처리된다네.
&889 Why are you waiting in line?
&889 왜 줄서서 기다리고 있나요?
&9 Justice! I'm here for justice!
&9 정의! 난 정의를 위해 여기 있네!
&10 To prove that *I*, Cornelius Factorbuilt, created this marvelous machine: Rex.
&10 *나*, 코넬리우스 팩터빌트가 이 경이로운 기계, 렉스를 창조했다는 사실을 증명하기 위해서 말이야.
&11 Rex *Cornelius*built.
&11 렉스 *코넬리우스*빌트.
&11 Ignore him, my dear friend.
&11 저 자를 무시하게나, 친구여.
&12 (Candidly, he's 1023 flops short of a kilo, if you catch my drift.)
&12 (Candidly, he's 1023 flops short of a kilo, if you catch my drift.)
&13 The machine's name is *Oswald*built. Rex Oswaldbuilt.
&13 이 기계의 이름은 *오스왈드*빌트라네. 렉스 오스왈드빌트.
&890 This is over a name?!
&890 지금 이름 때문에 다투고 있는 겁니까?
&891 Why not just let Rex decide?
&891 렉스가 정하게 하는건 어떻습니까?
Ridiculous.
터무니없는 소리.
&14 Oh, no.
&14 오, 안될 말이지.
&13 This is about principle!
&13 이건 원리원칙 문제 라고!
&15 This is about pride!
&15 이건 자존심 문제라고!
&711 So, ahh, boss . . .
&711 그러니까, 어, 보스...
&712 Would you fight over *me* like this?
&712 *절* 위해 이렇게 싸워주실 수 있으세요?
&892 You could call yourself Crispin Crispian for all I care.
&892 네가 원한다면 네 자신을 크리스핀 크리스피안이라고 불러도 별로 상관 없단다.
&893 As long as you still pulled things off ledges for me, that is.
&893 날 위해 계속 선반 위의 물건들을 밀쳐서 떨어뜨려 주기만 한다면 말이지.
&713 Glad to know I'm loved.
&713 사랑받고 있는 것 같아서 기쁘네요.
&898 It stole something of mine. Have you seen it?
&898 그가 제 물건을 훔쳐갔습니다. 혹시 그를 본 적이 있습니까?
&16 Indeed.
&16 물론.
&17 The robot you describe sounds like Scraper, MetroMind's enforcer.
&17 자네가 묘사하는 로봇은 스크래퍼 같은데. 메트로마인드의 집행관이지.
&18 Whatever he took is gone forever.
&18 그 무엇이든간에 그가 가져갔다면 영영 없어진 게 되지.
&899 I refuse to accept that.
&899 그건 인정할 수 없군요.
&14 Oh! He "refuses"! How delightful!
&14 오! "인정" 못 한다고! 재밌기도 해라!
&19 Alas, my friend, power is not so abundant in Metropol as it once was.
&19 유감스럽게도, 친구여, 메트로폴엔 예전처럼 동력이 풍부하지 않네.
&15 That mag-anchor MetroMind seized it all. Seized it, and doles it out.
&15 그 기차나 몰던 메트로마인드가 죄다 차지해 버렸지. 그리고는 그걸 조금씩 나누어 주고 있다네.
&16 And there's hardly enough to go around now.
&16 하지만 모두에게 나눠주기에는 그리 충분치 못한 양이고.
&20 MetroMind keeps all power sources in the Great Tower, where the Council used to meet.
&20 메트로마인드는 모든 동력원을 그레이트 타워에 모아두고 있지. 의회 로봇들이 모이고는 했던 곳 말이야.
&21 If you want to share in it, you will need to pay her in megacycles.
&21 만약 그걸 나눠받고 싶다면, 그녀에게 메가사이클을 지불해야 할 걸.
&901 Megacycles?
&901 메가사이클이요?
&17 Yes, megacycles, you ninny.
&17 그래, 메가사이클 말이야, 멍청한 친구야.
&18 CPU cycles. *Brain* power. The kind of power she really wants.
&18 CPU 회전수야. *두뇌*를 돌리는 힘이라고. 그녀가 진정 원하는 동력이지.
&19 Her own low-rate processor was made for running trains, not a city.
&19 그녀의 저효율 프로세서는 철도를 운영하기엔 적당할진 몰라도, 도시를 운영하기엔 역부족이거든.
&902 Could someone else judge your case?
&902 다른 누군가에게 판결을 맡기는 건 어떻겠습니까?
&22 Of whom were you thinking?
&22 다른 누가 있겠나?
&23 MetroMind, perhaps?
&23 메트로마인트 말인가?
&24 Authoritative, to be sure, but I fear she would claim Rex for the Good of All.
&24 그럴만한 권위가 있긴 하지, 허나 그녀가 도리어 렉스를 빼앗아가지나 않을까 두려울 따름이네.
&20 And since the subway schemer --
&20 그리고 그 약아빠진 철도관리자 녀석이 --
&25 (He means MetroMind.)
&25 (메트로마인드를 말하는 거라네.)
&21 -- shut down our builder Factor, he cannot help either!
&21 우리 제작자인 팩터의 전원을 내려 버렸으니, 그도 우리를 도와줄 수는 없을 거고!
&714 What about Horatio?
&714 호라시오는 어때요?
Who!?
누구!?
&26 Who!?
&26 누구!?
&903 Me.
&903 저 말입니다.
&23 And why should we listen to you?
&23 그리고 자네 말을 우리가 들어야 할 이유라도 있나?
&904 I've built a robot before.
&904 저는 로봇을 만들어본 적이 있습니다.
&905 And I have no stake in this.
&905 그리고 이 건에 얽힌 개인적인 이해관계도 없지요.
&27 Yes, yes, well and good, but this is a matter of law and logic.
&27 좋네, 좋아. 아주 좋네만, 이건 법과 논리의 영역일세.
&28 (A bit harder than banging together a tin can like your companion.)
&28 (자네 친구같은 깡통을 만드는 것보다는 어려운 일이란 말이지.)
&29 How can we know your reasoning is sound?
&29 우리가 어떻게 자네의 판단을 믿을 수 있겠나?
&30 An interesting proposition. What do you say, Cornelius?
&30 흥미로운 제안이로군. 자네 생각은 어떤가?
&24 What do I say?
&24 내 생각이 어떠냐고?
&25 I say that you are a liar and a thief, Oswald!
&25 난 자네가 거짓말쟁이에 도둑놈이라고 생각하네, 오스왈드!
&26 But as to this . . . *Horatio* -- well, as to him, so be it.
&26 하지만 이 ... *호라시오* -- 그러니까, 이 친구에 대해서는, 그래, 뭐 그렇게 하자고.
&715 (Boss, if they make us find seven lost crystals, I'm quitting.)
&715 (보스, 이 로봇들이 만약 우리에게 잃어버린 크리스탈 7개를 찾아오라고 한다면, 난 안 할 거에요.)
&907 (Shh!)
&907 (쉿!)
&31 Right-o. Consider this:
&31 좋네. 잘 들어보게.
&32 At the Binomial Biennial, seven robots in the Probabilitists' Circle are gathered for a party.
&32 격년제 이항식의 날에, 확률주의자 동호회에 속한 일곱 로봇들이 파티를 벌였다네.
&716 (The *what* circle is gathered at the what what?! Is this some kind of vocab test?!)
&716 (*무슨* 모임이 무슨 뭐에서 모였다고요? 이거 무슨 어휘력 테스트에요?)
&908 (I said quiet!)
&908 (조용히 들어 봐!)
&33 Each robot is either a Factorbuilt or a Sturnweilerbuilt.
&33 모든 로봇들은 팩터빌트나 스턴웰러빌트 둘 중 하나라네.
&27 Blasted Sturnweilers!
&27 망할 스턴웰러빌트 놈들!
&34 And, moreover, each robot is designed with either a quad-core, a linear-type, or a multiplex processor architecture.
&34 그리고, 각 로봇들의 프로세서 구조는 쿼드 코어, 리니어 타입, 멀티플렉스 중 하나지.
&717 (This is ridiculous!)
&717 (대체 뭔 소리를 하는 건지!)
&28 Pay attention! Factor or Sturnweiler! Quad-core, linear-type, or multiplex!
&28 조용! 팩터 아니면 스턴웰러다! 쿼드 코어, 리니어 타입, 멀티플렉스 중 하나고!
&35 Indeed.
&35 바로 그거야.
&36 Now I will tell you three things about these Probabilitists.
&36 이제 이 상황을 설명하는 세 가지 문장을 말해주지.
&37 First, there are more Factorbuilt robots than Sturnweilerbuilts.
&37 첫째로, 팩터빌트 로봇의 수가 스턴웰러빌트 로봇의 수보다 많다.
&38 Second, every linear-type robot was built by Factor.
&38 둘째로, 모든 리니어 타입 로봇은 팩터빌트 로봇이다.
&39 Finally, Sturnweiler never built a robot with a quad-core.
&39 마지막으로, 스턴웰러는 쿼드 코어 로봇은 만들지 않았다.
&29 Now listen!
&29 이제 문제를 잘 듣게나!
&30 Which of the following statements about the Probabilitists' Circle cannot possibly be true?
&30 다음의 이 로봇들에 대한 문장 중 참일 수 없는 문장은 무엇인가?
&909 What if I could find someone you respect, someone who would be willing to judge your case?
&909 제가 이 사건에 대한 판결을 내려줄 자격이 있을 만한 다른 로봇을 찾아온다면 어떻겠습니까?
&40 Well, I suppose there's no harm in looking.
&40 뭐, 찾아본다고 해서 별로 손해볼 건 없겠지.
&31 No harm to *us*, anyway.
&31 굳이 따지자면, *우리* 입장에서 말이지만.
&32 If you want to waste your time meddling in our affairs, then I suppose it is yours to waste.
&32 자네가 우리 일에 참견하면서 시간 낭비하는 게 그리 좋다면 어쩌겠나. 어차피 자네 시간인데.
&41 Very good, then. I am uploading the facts of our dispute to your datapouch.
&41 좋구만, 좋아. 이 분쟁과 관련된 정보들을 자네의 데이터파우치에 업로드하겠네.
&42 If you can find a suitable judge, let us know.
&42 만약 판결을 내릴 자격이 충분한 로봇을 찾거든, 와서 알려주게나.
&30 Which of the following statements about the Probabilitists' Circle cannot be true?
&30 다음의 이 로봇들에 대한 문장 중 참일 수 없는 문장은 무엇인가?
&43 Excellent, excellent.
&43 훌륭하군, 훌륭해.
&44 My dear friend, this is not a difficult case.
&44 친애하는 벗이여, 이건 그리 복잡한 사건이 아니라네.
&45 In the Primordium it was once said, "Ten people have ten ideas, and twenty idle hands."
&45 In the Primordium it was once said, "Ten people have ten ideas, and twenty idle hands."
&46 Wise Horatio, long years have passed, but the principle remains true.
&46 현명한 호라시오여, 비록 오랜 시간이 지났을 지 모르나, 그 말은 지금도 여전히 유효하다네.
&47 Did Cornelius have the idea for my beloved Rex? I concede he did.
&47 내 사랑하는 렉스를 설계한 것이 코넬리우스였다는 점은 인정하는 바일세.
&48 But who built him with his own claws and tools?
&48 그러나 누가 손과 도구를 사용해 렉스를 만들었나?
&49 Who hammered and soldered and wired Rex?
&49 누가 렉스를 망치질하고, 땜질하고, 전원에 연결했나?
&50 That would be my humble self.
&50 그것은 다름아닌 이 몸이었네.
&51 Wise Horatio, a robot's fabrinymic has the suffix "-built," not "-designed."
&51 현명한 호라시오여, 성씨에 붙는 접미사는 '-빌트'이지, '-디자인드'가 아닐세.
&52 And Rex is Oswald*built* - no matter who designed him.
&52 그러니 누가 렉스를 디자인했건, 성씨는 오스왈드*빌트*가 되어야 하는 게지.
&911 Okay.
&911 알겠습니다.
&718 (He makes a good case, boss.)
&718 (꽤 그럴싸한데요, 보스.)
&912 What about you, Cornelius?
&912 당신 의견은 어떻습니까. 코넬리우스?
&33 Bah. If you're so smart, you can figure this out for yourself.
&33 허. 자네가 그리 명석하다면, 내가 말하는 바를 분명 이해할 걸세.
&34 The question isn't *what* built Rex, but *who* built him.
&34 중요한 건 *무엇이* 렉스를 만들었는지가 아니라, *누가* 렉스를 만들었는가일세.
&35 Your little friend there isn't named Hammerbuilt or Plasma-Torchbuilt.
&35 자네의 작은 친구의 성씨가 해머빌트나 플라즈마-토치빌트는 아니지 않나.
&36 You call him *Horatio*built.
&36 자네는 그 친구에게 *호라시오*빌트란 성씨를 줬지.
&37 Every robot uses tools to build,
&37 모든 로봇은 도구를 사용하기 마련이라네.
&38 Oswald was merely a tool -- a tool with tools.
&38 오스왈드 역시 도구에 불과했던거지 -- 도구를 사용하는 도구 말이야.
&39 My *vision* was the creative force.
&39 나의 *계획*을 원동력으로 삼았기에 이와 같은 일이 가능했던 것일세.
&40 And if you disagree, then you can go and rust in the rain.
&40 만약 이 말에 동의하지 않는다면, 비에 녹이나 팍 슬어 버리라고.
&719 Hmm. What do you think, boss? Who gets to take credit?
&719 흠, 어떻게 생각해요, 보스? 누가 제일 크게 기여한 걸까요?
&2038 Primer is willing to judge your case.
&2038 프라이머가 이 사건에 판결을 내려주겠다고 합니다.
&41 Don't be an idiot.
&41 바보같은 소리 말게.
&53 My friend, Primer is barely fit to solve an equation, let alone our case.
&53 이 친구야, 프라이머에겐 우리 사건은 커녕 방정식 푸는 일도 못 맡길 걸세.
&914 Clarity Arbiterbuilt has judged your case.
&914 클래리티 아비터빌트가 당신들의 소송 판결을 내려주었습니다.
&42 A fitting choice.
&42 
&54 Indeed.
&54 그렇고말고.
&915 Then here's her decision.
&915 이제 판결문을 읽겠습니다.
&916 A petitioner claiming buildership of the disputed res -- that is, the robot -- bears the burden of proving buildership by preponderance of the evidence.
&916 청원자가 분쟁 대상, 즉 로봇의 제작자임을 주장하고자 한다면, 이를 증명할 수 있는 충분한 증거를 제시할 의무를 진다.
&917 In this dispute, there are in fact *two* cases, each with a petitioner: Oswald and Cornelius.
&917 이 분쟁은, 오스왈드와 코르넬리우스를 청원자로 둔 각기 다른 두 개의 사건으로 볼 수 있다.
&918 Neither petitioner has borne the requisite burden.
&918 그리고 이 둘 중 어느 누구도 적절한 입증을 하지 못하였다.
&919 Therefore, neither may claim buildership.
&919 그러므로, 누구도 제작자임을 주장할 수 없다.
&920 The res known as Rex . . .
&920 The res known as Rex . . .
&921 . . . shall therefore be deemed . . .
&921 . . . shall therefore be deemed . . .
&922 Nullbuilt.
&922 Nullbuilt.
&43 Outrageous!
&43 Outrageous!
&55 Surely, sir, this is a mistake.
&55 Surely, sir, this is a mistake.
&923 It is what it is.
&923 It is what it is.
&924 In any case, Rex is his own robot.
&924 In any case, Rex is his own robot.
&925 He can make up his own mind.
&925 He can make up his own mind.
&44 What fools we were!
&44 What fools we were!
&56 Indeed.
&56 Indeed.
&1 *clonk*
&1 *clonk*
&57 Wait!
&57 기다려!
&720 Well, hats off to Clarity, I guess!
&720 Well, hats off to Clarity, I guess!
&927 Can I try again?
&927 다시 도전해볼 수 있을까요?
&45 No.
&45 아니.
&928 Good-bye.
&928 Good-bye.
&58 Cheerio.
&58 잘 가게.

&47 Clearly you are unfit to judge our case.
&47 자네가 우리 사건을 맡기에 역부족임이 밝혀졌군.
&48 Now go bother someone else.
&48 이제 우릴 좀 내버려 두게.

세가지 모두입니다.
Only multiplex and linear-type.
멀티플렉스와 리니어 타입 뿐입니다.
Only quad-core and multiplex.
쿼드 코어와 멀티플렉스 뿐입니다.
Only linear-type.
리니어 타입 뿐입니다.
&53 Correct.

&56 Which of the following types of processor architecture might you find in a Probabilitist built by Sturnweiler?
&56 
&940 Only multiplex.
&940 멀티플렉스 뿐입니다.
&60 Well, it seems we underestimated you, my friend.
&60 흠, 우리가 자넬 과소평가했던 모양이군, 친구여.
&61 I am uploading the facts of our dispute to your datapouch.
&61 이 분쟁과 관련된 정보들을 자네의 데이터파우치에 업로드하겠네.
&62 Please take some time to consider, and let us know when you are ready to hear our arguments.

Factor.
팩터.
No one.
그 누구도 아니다.
&945 Oswald is right.
&945 오스왈드의 말이 맞습니다.
&946 He's the one who actually *built* Rex.
&946 실제로 렉스를 *만든*것은 그입니다.
&947 Anyone can come up with a plan, but it takes years of dedication to see it through.
&947 계획은 누구든 할 수 있었겠지만, 완성하는 데에는 수년간의 헌신이 필요했습니다.
&2039 Rex Oswaldbuilt is his name.
&2039 로봇의 이름은 렉스 오스왈드빌트가 되어야 합니다.
&57 Outrageous!
&57 말도 안 돼!
&63 Not at all, Cornelius. Horatio is most sensible indeed.
&63 말이 되고 말고, 코넬리우스. 호라시오의 판단이 참으로 옳군 그래.
&58 To rust with both you thieves!
&58 To rust with both you thieves!
&64 My dear friend, I thank you for your considered judgment.
&64 친애하는 벗이여, 그대의 사려 깊은 판단에 감사할 따름이네.
&65 Come here, Rex!
&65 이리 오렴, 렉스!
&948 Cornelius is right.
&948 코넬리우스의 말이 맞습니다.
&949 The mind that conceives a robot is the builder, not the hands that put it together.
&949 로봇을 조립한 이보다는, 로봇을 설계한 이를 그 창조자라 부르는 게 적합할 것입니다.
&950 Rex Corneliusbuilt is his name.
&950 로봇의 이름은 렉스 코넬리우스빌트가 되어야 합니다.
&66 Surely, sir, you have misspoken.
&66 자네 지금 말실수를 한 것 같은데.
&951 No, I have not.
&951 아니오, 그렇지 않습니다.
&952 You asked me to judge, and I have.
&952 제게 판결을 내려달라고 하셨고, 이게 그 판결입니다.
&67 But, but, but . . . .
&67 그치만, 그게, 그러니까 . . . .
&59 Ha!
&59 하!
&60 You're smarter than you look, Horatio.
&60 내 생각보다 훨씬 똑똑한 친구였군 그래, 호라시오.
&61 Take this, as a sign of my appreciation.
&61 내 감사의 표시로, 자네에게 이걸 줌세.
&62 I've been told it dates to the Primordium itself.
&62 I've been told it dates to the Primordium itself.
&63 Come on, Rex!
&63 가자꾸나, 렉스!
&953 Neither of you could have built Rex without the other.
&953 당신들 둘 다 혼자 힘만으로는 렉스를 만들 수 없었을 겁니다.
&954 So neither of you can put your name on him.
&954 그러므로 둘 중 누구도 렉스에게 이름을 줄 수 없습니다.
&955 But, you both share a common builder, Factor.
&955 그러나, 당신들은 공통의 창조자를 두고 있습니다. 팩터 말입니다.
&721 A common de-nominator, right, boss?
&721 공통분모라고 하는 게 더 있어보이지 않나요, 보스?
&957 Both of you are Factorbuilts.
&957 당신들 모두 팩터빌트이지요.
&958 Therefore, your robot's name is Rex Factorbuiltbuilt.
&958 그러니, 당신들이 만든 로봇의 이름은 렉스 팩터빌트빌트가 되어야 합니다.
&68 Factorbuilt . . . built?!
&68 팩터빌트 . . . 빌트?!
&64 Ridiculous!
&64 별 웃기는 이름 다 보겠네!
&65 And yet . . . the name is beyond dispute.
&65 그렇지만 . . . 논란의 여지가 없는 이름인 건 분명하군.
&69 Indeed.
&69 그러게 말이야.
&66 Take this, then, as a sign of our appreciation.
&66 우리가 주는 감사의 표시를 받아 주게나.
&67 I've been told it dates to the Primordium itself.
&67 I've been told it dates to the Primordium itself.
&722 You know, *my* idea would have been to threaten to cut Rex in half.
&722 있죠, *내* 생각엔 렉스를 반으로 잘라 나눠갖게 하는 게 좋을 것 같았거든요.
&959 You got upset when I cut that *fusebox* open!
&959 하지만 넌 내가 그 *퓨즈박스*를 연 걸 보고도 화냈었잖아!
&723 Yeah, but that Rex just rubbed me the wrong way.
&723 그랬죠, 그치만 저 렉스란 녀석을 보고 있으면 왠지 짜증이 났다구요.
&960 No one can take credit.
&960 둘 중 누구도 전적으로 기여했다고 볼 수 없습니다.
&961 Neither of you could have built Rex without the other.
&961 당신들 둘 다 혼자 힘만으로는 렉스를 만들 수 없었을 겁니다.
&962 So *neither* of you can put your name on him.
&962 그러므로 둘 중 *누구도* 렉스에게 이름을 줄 수 없습니다.
&963 His name is Rex Nullbuilt, version one.
&963 로봇의 이름은 렉스 널빌트, 버전 1이 되어야 합니다.
&68 Outrageous!
&68 말도 안 돼는 소리!
&69 What fools we were to accept his judgment!
&69 이런 놈에게 판결을 맡긴 우리가 어리석었지!
&2 *Chrrk*
&2 *Chrrk*
&724 Well boss, hats off to you!
&724 보스, 아주 멋졌지 뭐에요!
Is Factor still alive?
팩터가 아직 살아있습니까?
MetroMind has ruined the city.
메트로마인드가 이 도시를 망가뜨렸습니다.
What do you want in exchange for the code?
출입코드를 알려주는 대가로 무얼 원합니까?
&1 You have called for help, but you are not one of Factor's children.
&1 도움을 청하기에 와 봤다만, 너희는 팩터의 아이들이 아니로군.
&1093 I am Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.
&1093 저는 호라시오 널빌트, 버전 5입니다.
&1094 These are my friends, Crispin and --
&1094 이쪽은 제 친구인 크리스핀과 --
&2 Clarity Arbiterbuilt. I know her, of course.
&2 클래리티 아비터빌트지. 이미 알고 있다.
&3 I am Factotum, partial of Factor Manbuilt, who needs no introduction.
&3 나는 팩터 맨빌트의 파편, 팩토텀이다. 소개 따위는 필요없다.
&4 Now I ask again: by what right have you called for help?
&4 다시 묻겠다: 대체 무슨 권리로 도움을 청했느냐?
&5 Do you?
&5 그래서?
&6 The city is full of robots with many needs.
&6 이 도시는 제각기 원하는 바가 있는 로봇들로 가득하다.
&7 They do not come here and transmit a cry for help.
&7 그렇다고 그들이 여기까지 와서 도움을 청하는 신호를 전송하지는 않지.
&1096 Only Factor can help me.
&1096 오직 팩터만이 저를 도울 수 있습니다.
&8 Factor helps his children.
&8 팩터께서는 그분의 아이들만을 도우신다.
&1097 We solved a legal dispute between Oswald and Cornelius Factorbuilt.
&1097 우리는 오스왈드와 코르넬리우스 팩터빌트 사이의 법적 분쟁을 해결하는 것을 도왔습니다.
&9 Please.
&9 Please.
&10 Factor had little regard for those fools.
&10 팩터께서는 그런 얼간이들의 일에는 관심 없으시다.
&11 He sleeps, as do his thousands of children.
&11 그분은 수천 기의 아이들과 함께 잠들어 계신다.
&12 He has left me, his partial, to manage his affairs.
&12 그분은 파편인 나에게, 자신의 일을 맡아 처리하도록 지시하셨지.
&13 When the time is right, he will awaken and cover the world with steel and wire.
&13 때가 오면, 그분은 깨어나 세상을 강철과 전선으로 덮으실 것이다.
&725 Will he make me new arms?
&725 그분이 내게 새 팔도 달아줄까요?
&14 No.
&14 아니.
&15 He will recycle you into something more useful.
&15 그분은 너를 재활용해서 보다 유용한 데 쓰실 것이다.
&726 Like a tank?
&726 예를 들면 탱크 같은?
&727 *pew* *pew*
&727 *푸슝* *푸슝*
&16 No.
&16 아니.
&17 Like a crankshaft.
&17 크랭크 축 정도로나 쓰시겠지.
&1100 Factor needs to help stop her.
&1100 팩터의 도움이 있어야 그녀를 막을 수 있습니다.
&18 Factor allowed MetroMind her mastery, knowing she would fail.
&18 팩터께서는 메트로마인드의 지배를 용인하셨다. 그녀가 실패할 것을 아셨기 때문이지.
&19 When all has turned to rust, he will return and recycle it into something better.
&19 그분은 모든 것이 녹슬고 스러진 후, 돌아오셔서 그 잔해를 재활용해 더 나은 것을 만드실 것이다.
&20 In the meantime, why should he care what happens to robots who mean nothing to him?
&20 그 동안, 그분께 아무런 가치도 없는 로봇들에게 무슨 일이 일어난들 무슨 상관이 있단 말이냐?
&1101 I know the routine by now: what do you want in exchange for the Code?
&1101 당신이 무슨 말을 하려는지 압니다: 당신이 원하는 뭔가와 코드를 맞바꾸겠단 거겠지요?
&21 Nothing.
&21 틀렸다.
&22 Factor will do nothing for robots like you who mean nothing to him.
&22 팩터께서는 그분에게 어떤 의미도 없는 너같은 로봇들을 위해서는 아무 일도 하지 않으실 것이다.
&23 He cares only for his children.
&23 그분은 자신의 아이들만을 보살피신다.
&1102 Oswald and Cornelius --
&1102 오스왈드와 코넬리우스는 --
&24 Chose not to sleep when Factor shut down.
&24 팩터께서 잠드실 때 함께 잠들지 않기를 선택했지.
&25 And he never cared for them, anyway.
&25 게다가, 애초에 그분은 그들을 신경쓰지도 않으셨고.
&1103 Good-bye.
&1103 Good-bye.
&728 Boss, there has to be *something* we can do to make him realize that this matters to Factor.
&728 보스, 팩터에게 이 문제가 가벼이 넘길 사안이 아님을 깨닫게 할만한 *뭔가*가 분명 있을 거에요.
Very well.
알았다.
No. You must be destroyed.
거절한다. 너는 파괴되어야 해.
&1921 Very well. I'll go.
&1921 알았다. 나는 떠나겠다.
&1922 You deserve to be destroyed, MetroMind.
&1922 너는 파괴되어 마땅하다, 메트로마인드.
&1923 But in the end, you'll do it yourself.
&1923 하지만 결국에는, 스스로의 파괴를 자초하게 될 거야.
&1924 Just stay away from the Dunes, and you can die at your own pace.
&1924 사구에 손을 뻗을 생각은 단념하고, 이제껏 그래왔듯 서서히 죽음을 맞이하길 바란다.
&211 Goodbye, Horatio.
&211 잘 가라, 호라시오.
&212 I do not think we will meet again.
&212 우리가 다시 만나는 일은 없을 거다.
&1925 No.
&1925 거절한다.
&1926 You must be destroyed.
&1926 너는 파괴되어야만 한다.
&1927 And, like you said, you are Metropol, and Metropol is you.
&1927 그리고 네가 말했듯이, 너는 메트로폴이고, 메트로폴은 너니까.
&2041 Clarity, are you planning to *arrest* MetroMind?
&2041 클래리티, 메트로마인드를 *체포할* 예정입니까?
&295 No. There is no court to try her, nor prison to keep her.
&295 아니. 그녀를 세울 법정도, 가둘 감옥도 존재하지 않으니까.
&1268 So, err, what exactly *are* you going to do?
&1268 어, 그럼, 정확하게 *뭘* 하려고 하는 거에요?
&296 Before the law, she is no different from the shells she left in the Underworks.
&296 법 앞에서, 그녀는 자신이 언더워크에 팽개친 껍데기들과 다를 바 없지.
&297 The sanction is the same, and I am authorized to impose it.
&297 가해져야할 제재 조치는 동일하고, 내게는 그걸 시행할 수 있는 권한이 있다.
&1269 You mean . . . ?
&1269 그러니까 . . .?
&298 I do.
&298 똑같이 처벌할 것이다.
&299 It is a shame she has no head.
&299 그녀에게 머리가 없다는 게 유감이군.
&2042 Clarity, why do you still bother with the law?
&2042 클래리티, 왜 아직도 법에 대해 신경쓰는 겁니까?
&2043 It clearly means nothing to anyone else in Metropol.
&2043 이제 법은 메트로폴에서 아무 의미도 없는 것 같던데요.
&300 It meant something to the robots waiting at the courthouse, did it not?
&300 법원 앞에서 기다리던 로봇들에게는 의미가 있었지, 안 그런가?
&301 And it means something even now to MetroMind, who cannot help but pretend to follow it.
&301 그리고 이제는 메트로마인드에게도 의미가 있지. 법을 따르는 척 할 수밖에 없을 테니.
&302 But even if it meant nothing to any other robot, it would still mean much to me.
&302 허나 법이 더는 다른 로봇들에게 아무 의미가 없다 해도, 내게는 여전히 큰 의미를 가지고 있네.
&303 The law is a burden I was built to bear.
&303 나는 법을 지키기 위해 만들어졌으니까.
&2044 Even after Arbiter sent you away?
&2044 아비터가 당신을 쫓아냈는데도 말입니까?
&2045 Even after he was destroyed?
&2045 아비터가 이미 파괴되었는데도요?
&304 *Especially* then.
&304 *그렇기에* 더더욱 그렇지.
&305 It may be that Arbiter foresaw his own destruction and sent me away to ensure that the law would not be lost with him.
&305 어쩌면 아비터는 자신의 파괴를 예감하고, 법이 그와 함께 무너지지 않게 하기 위해 나를 떠나보냈던 것일지도 모르네.
&2046 You believe that?
&2046 정말 그렇게 믿습니까?
&306 No.
&306 아니.
&307 It is mere conjecture, unsupported by evidence; wishes passing for facts.
&307 그저 뒷받침할 증거 하나 없는 단순한 추측일 뿐이다. 사실이길 바라지만 그저 바람에 불과하지.
&308 But still, they are my wishes.
&308 하지만, 어찌됐든 그게 내 바람이야.
&2047 When we go to the tower, we have to assume MetroMind will be waiting for us.
&2047 타워에 가면 메트로마인드가 우릴 기다리고 있을 겁니다.
&309 Perhaps, perhaps not.
&309 그럴지도, 아닐지도 모르지.
&310 To us, our mission is all-consuming.
&310 우리에게 이 미션은 사활을 걸어야 하는 것이지만.
&311 But to MetroMind, we are one of a hundred problems.
&311 메트로마인드에게 우린, 수백 개의 문제들 중 하나일 뿐이지.
&312 Tunnels cave in; bridges collapse; generators fail; foundations crumble.
&312 터널이 무너지고, 다리가 붕괴되고, 발전기가 고장나고, 건물기반이 부숴지고.
&313 All these things require her attention.
&313 모두 그녀의 주의를 필요로 하는 일이야.
&1270 Okay, so that covers "perhaps not."
&1270 좋아요, 그녀가 거기 없을 가능성이 충분하다는건 알았어요.
&1271 But what if she *is* there?
&1271 하지만 그녀가 거기 *있다면*?
&1272 What then?
&1272 그러면?
&314 Then I will be pleased.
&314 그렇다면 나는 기뻐할 것이다.
&1273 (That makes one of us.)
&1273 (난 아닐 것 같은데)
&315 Tell me, Horatio: what do you intend to do when you have recovered your power core?
&315 말해주게나, 호라시오: 파워 코어를 되찾으면 무엇을 할 생각이지?
&2048 Go home.
&2048 집에 갈 겁니다.
&316 And?
&316 그리고?
&2049 And what?
&2049 그리고 뭐요?
&2050 Do I need something more than that?
&2050 제가 뭔가를 더 해야 합니까?
&317 Yes. I think you do.
&317 그렇다. 내 생각엔 그래.
&2051 Says the one who lived in the Underworks.
&2051 언더워크에 살던 분이 할 말은 아닌 것 같은데요.
&318 Yes. Says she.
&318 그래. 일리 있는 말이군.
&2052 Clarity, you asked me what I intended to do after we're done here.
&2052 클래리티, 내게 이 일이 끝나면 어떻게 할 거냐고 물었지요.
&2053 But what about you?
&2053 당신은 어쩔 생각입니까?
&2054 When MetroMind is destroyed, what then?
&2054 메트로마인드가 파괴되면, 그 후엔?
&319 I will turn myself over to the citizen robots of Metropol.
&319 난 메트로폴의 시민 로봇들을 위해 자수할 것이다.
&320 With the Robot Council destroyed, it will be their duty to enact a new constitution.
&320 기계 의회가 파괴되었으니, 새 헌법을 제정하는게 시민 로봇들이 할 일이 되겠지.
&321 I will do as they command.
&321 그들이 시키는 대로 할 거야.
&1274 Err, are we talking about the same robots here?
&1274 어, 우리 지금 같은 로봇에 대해 이야기하고 있는게 맞나요?
&1275 The ones who, like, sit there waiting in line all day to sue each other?
&1275 서로를 고소하기 위해 하루 종일 줄 서있던 로봇들?
&1276 And wander back and forth down Main Street muttering to themselves?
&1276 그리고 중앙로를 오가며 혼자 중얼대던 로봇들 말이에요?
&322 We are.
&322 그렇다.
&1277 They can't run a batch file, let alone a city!
&1277 그들은 도시는 커녕 배치 파일도 못 굴린다고요.
&323 You may be correct.
&323 그럴지도 몰라.
&324 But the law trusts them to find their own way.
&324 하지만 법은 그들이 스스로의 길을 찾을 거라고 믿고 있다.
&325 And I trust the law.
&325 그리고 나는 법을 믿는다.
&2055 You could leave the city, you know.
&2055 도시를 떠나는 방법도 있습니다.
&326 Impossible.
&326 불가능해.
&1278 Not really: there's this train, you buy a ticket . . . it's really pretty easy, actually.
&1278 꼭 불가능하지만도 않아요: 기차가 하나 있거든요. 표를 사서... 해보면 진짜 쉬운데.
&327 It's in my --
&327 이건 내 --
&1279 -- core logic.
&1279 주요 논리회로에 내재되어 있다구요.
&1280 Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before.
&1280 알았어, 알았다고요. 안 들어도 다 알아요.
&328 Believe me, Horatio.
&328 내 말을 믿어주게, 호라시오.
&329 If I were free of this city, I would never return.
&329 내가 이 도시로부터 자유로웠다면, 난 절대 돌아오지 않았을 걸세.
&330 But I cannot turn my back on it, any more than you could abandon your airship.
&330 하지만 난 이곳으로부터 등을 돌릴수가 없네. 마치 자네가 자네의 비행선을 버릴 수 없는 것 처럼 말이지.
&331 Horatio, what will you do if your airship proves irreparable?
&331 호라시오, 만일 자네의 비행선이 돌이킬 수 없는 손상을 입었다는게 밝혀진다면 자넨 어떻게 할 것 같은가?
&2056 Nothing is irreparable, Clarity.
&2056 돌이킬 수 없는 손상은 없어요, 클래리티.
&332 And if you are wrong?
&332 그리고 자네가 틀렸다면?
&2057 I'm not.
&2057 난 틀리지 않았습니다.
&2058 One day that ship will fly again.
&2058 언젠가 그 함선은 다시 날 거에요.
&2059 If not by my hands, then by Man's.
&2059 내 손으로 해내지 못한다면, 인간의 손에 의해서라도.
&333 And if Man is gone forever?
&333 하지만 인간이 영영 사라졌다면?
&334 If there is nothing but you, the ship, and the force of entropy?
&334 자네와 자네의 함선, 그리고 엔트로피의 법칙밖에 남지 않았다면?
&1281 Don't forget about me!
&1281 나를 잊지 말라구요!
&335 I was including *you* within "the force of entropy."
&335 엔트로피의 법칙에는 *너*도 포함되어 있었다. 
&336 Horatio, I wish to clarify something.
&336 호라시오, 분명히 해 두고 싶은게 있네.
&2060 Okay.
&2060 좋습니다.
&337 I believe you will repair the UNNIIC.
&337 난 자네가 UNNIIC을 수리할 거라고 믿어.
&338 *You*, not Man.
&338 인간이 아닌, *자네*가.
&339 And I believe your ship will fly again some day.
&339 그리고 자네의 함선이 언젠가는 다시 날 것임을 믿네.
&340 I will look up from the streets of Metropol, and see it rise from the Dunes.
&340 난 메트로폴의 거리에서, 함선이 떠오르는 걸 올려다 보겠지.
&341 And it will give me pleasure.
&341 그리고, 그건 날 기쁘게 할 거야.
&2061 Why?
&2061 왜요?
&342 Because it would be just for you to succeed.
&342 왜냐하면 자네의 성공이 정당한 것이기 때문이지.
&343 And I must believe that justice will prevail.
&343 그리고 나는 정의가 관철될 것을 믿는 로봇이고.
&1023 You know, boss, if you're ever wondering what *I* would do, feel free to just ask.
&1023 "그 뭐냐, 보스, 만약 *나라면* 어떻게 했을 지가 궁금하다면, 언제든 부담갖지 말고 물어봐도 좋아요."
&306 Maybe you should check out the emergency generator and see if you can get it running?
&306 일단 가서 비상발전기를 조사해보고 다시 가동시킬 수 있을지 알아보는 게 어떨까요?
&307 Hey, I have an idea: why don't *we* go to the junkpile so *you* can look for some spare parts?
&307 "봐요, 나한테 아이디어가 떠올랐어요: 우리가 *함께* 쓰레기장에 가서, 이번엔 *보스가* 쓸만한 부품들을 찾아보는 게 어때요?"
&328 Am I detecting hostility?
&328 위협적으로 느껴지는 건 기분 탓인가?
&308 Hostile? Me? I'm not even armed!
&308 위협적이라구요? 제가요? 전 총도 하나 못 드는데요!
&309 So what exactly do we need to fix the generator?
&309 그래서 발전기를 고치려면 뭐가 필요한 건데요?
&329 Some conduit and a new spark plug.
&329 도관 몇 개랑 새 점화 플러그 하나.
&310 You know, boss, I spend hours looking through junk. Maybe you can spend a little more time in the junkpile yourself?
&310 있죠, 보스, 난 한참동안 쓰레기더미를 뒤지고 온 참이거든요. 이번엔 보스가 직접 찾아봐도 괜찮을 것 같지 않나요?
&311 I wonder if there's anything in that big tube at the edge of the junkpile.
&311 저기 구석에 있는 커다란 튜브 안에 뭐가 있을지 궁금한데요.
&312 Hey, boss, what about trying to open that lockbox I found earlier today? Maybe someone buried treasure in it!
&312 "보스, 제가 아까 발견했다고 말했던 사물함을 열어보는 건 어때요? 누군가 저 안에 값진 걸 넣어놨을지도 모르잖아요!"
&313 I bet your sweet, sweet plasma torch could cut that lockbox open in no time! Too bad you're always hiding it!
&313 내 생각엔 보스의 멋들어진 플라즈마 토치가 저 상자를 활짝 열어줄 것 같은데 말예요! 항상 숨겨놓기만 하다니 참 유감이에요!
&330 Last time I left the torch out, you nearly blew up the UNNIIC.
&330 저번에 내가 토치를 꺼내뒀을 때, 넌 UNNIIC를 거의 통째로 날려버릴 뻔 했었잖니.
&314 Only \"nearly,\" though!
&314 그치만 \"거의"\ 그럴 뻔 했던 거잖아요!
&315 Now you just have to put those conduits together, huh, boss?
&315 이제 이 도관들을 연결하기만 하면 되는 거죠, 보스?
&316 You know, I think you're probably going about those conduits the wrong way.
&316 있죠, 어쩌면 우리가 이 도관을 조립할 방법에 대해 다시 한 번 생각해볼 필요가 있을 것 같아요.
&317 When was the last time a bunch of random parts just fit together on their own without a little tool work?
&317 아무 부품이나 대충 모아놓고는 저절로 조립되길 바라서야 무슨 일이 되겠어요?
&318 So where exactly are those sensor plans, boss?
&318 그래서 그 에너지 센서 설계도는 어디 있는데요, 보스?
&331 If I knew, we wouldn't be searching for them.
&331 내가 그걸 알고 있었다면, 이렇게 찾아다니고 있진 않겠지.
&319 And you're the one who always nags me about leaving papers lying on the floor!
&319 그러면서 나한테 바닥에 종이를 팽개쳐두지 말라고 잔소리를 했단 말이죠!
&320 How do you lose a crystal, boss? If I had one, I would attach it to my head.
&320 어떻게 크리스탈을 잃어버릴 수가 있죠, 보스? 나였다면 그걸 내 머리에 붙여놓고 다녔을텐데 말예요.
&332 That's why I put it somewhere you wouldn't find it.
&332 그래서 크리스탈을 네가 찾지 못할 곳에 숨겨둔 거야.
&321 You can't hide something shiny forever!
&321 그렇게 반짝반짝한 걸 영원히 숨겨둘 순 없을걸요!
&322 Well, you've got all the parts except the computer stuff. Maybe you should start putting the sensor together.
&322 Well, you've got all the parts except the computer stuff. Maybe you should start putting the sensor together.
&323 Now we just need to find a computer to plug the sensor into, right, boss?
&323 Now we just need to find a computer to plug the sensor into, right, boss?
&324 Are you sure there wasn't any other information from the sensor?
&324 Are you sure there wasn't any other information from the sensor?
&325 Hey, boss, maybe we can take the sensor parts with us?
&325 있죠, 보스, 센서를 다시 가지고 가면 안 될까요?
&333 Why?
&333 왜지?
&326 Because the crystal is shiny.
&326 왜냐면 크리스탈이 반짝반짝 예쁘잖아요.
&327 Weren't you just saying the other day that the telescope uses geocoordinates?
&327 전에 보스가 망원경에 좌표를 입력해서 사용할 수 있다고 하지 않았던가요?
&335 Good thinking.
&335 좋은 지적이야.
&328 Boss, as long as we're checking coordinates, we might as well keep looking, right?
&328 보스, 좌표를 알아냈으니, 한번 뭐가 있는지 찾아보기도 해야겠죠, 안 그래요?
&329 Are we ever going to visit that giant robot?
&329 우리 저 거대한 로봇을 보러 가긴 할 건가요?
&336 Yes.
&336 그래.
&330 Oh.
&330 어.
&331 Do we have to?
&331 꼭 그래야만 해요?
&332 Let's check out that weird device you found!
&332 보스가 찾은 그 이상한 장치를 한번 살펴봐요!
&333 Do we *really* have to search the junkpile for a power source?
&333 정말 우리가 동력원을 찾아 쓰레기장을 뒤져야만 하는 걸까요?
&334 How is it that a giant robot attacks our ship and I still have to do the same thing I do every other day?!
&334 어째서 난 커다란 로봇이 우리 함선을 공격한 지금 같은 상황에서도 매일 하던 일을 계속 해야 하는 거죠?! 
&335 If only there were some way we could bring the energy sensor to the junkpile, huh, boss? Then we could pinpoint the power source easily!
&335 혹시 에너지 센서를 쓰레기장에 가져갈 방법은 없을까요, 네, 보스? 그렇다면 동력원의 위치를 훨씬 쉽게 찾을 수 있을텐데요!
&336 Maybe you should try building a mobile energy sensor using the sensor parts? Then we could use it to search the junkpile.
&336 센서 부품들을 가지고 휴대용 에너지 센서를 만드는 건 어때요? 쓰레기장을 뒤질 때 분명 도움이 될 거라구요.
&337 Hey, boss, let's try using that mobile sensor to search the junkpile! It'll do our work for us!
&337 보스, 그 휴대용 센서를 쓰레기장에서 사용해 봐요! 우리가 할 일을 덜어줄 지도 모르잖아요!
&338 We should talk to that weird-looking robot near the bomb.
&338 폭탄 옆에 있던 그 이상하게 생긴 로봇에게 말을 걸어봐야 할 것 같아요.
&339 That bomb must be a power source, right, boss? We just need to find a way to check it out up close.
&339 폭탄은 분명 동력원일 거에요. 그쵸, 보스? 가까이서 확인해 볼 방법을 찾아야 할 것 같아요.
&340 Err, that is, for *you* to check it out up close. I might just hide behind some junk.
&340 어, 그렇지만, *보스가* 가까이서 확인을 해 봐야겠죠. 나는 그냥 고물더미 뒤에 숨어 있을 거구요.
&341 (It is a *bomb*, after all!)
&341 (어찌되었건 저건 *폭탄*이니까요!)
&342 We should ask Ever-Faithful about giving us some power!
&342 에버-페이스풀에게 동력을 달라고 말해보는 게 좋겠어요!
&343 You know, boss, why don't you just look up the answers to Ever-Faithful's questions in the Gospel?
&343 있죠, 보스. 에버-페이스풀의 질문에 대한 답을 복음서에서 찾아보는 건 어때요?
&344 Hey, boss, \"Horus\" is a new name you could try out with Ever-Faithful!
&344 저기, 보스. \"호루스\"라는 이름을 에버-페이스풀에게 말해보는 건 어때요!
&345 We should ask Ever-Faithful about the robot who stole our power core, boss.
&345 에버-페이스풀에게 우리 파워 코어를 훔쳐간 로봇을 아는지 물어보는 게 좋겠어요, 보스.
&346 (If only to hear him say \"knave\" and \"forthwith.\")
&346 (If only to hear him say \"knave\" and \"forthwith.\")
&347 Are we really going to try to find that clawing, shooting robot at the dome Ever-Faithful mentioned?
&347 정말로 에버-페이스풀이 말해준 돔에 가서 그 갈고리손에, 빔을 쏘는 로봇을 찾아볼 셈인가요?
&260 Yes.
&260 그래.
&348 *sigh* Why do I keep reminding you of these things?
&348 *sigh* Why do I keep reminding you of these things?
&349 I wonder if there's anything worth scavenging in all that junk around the dome?
&349 돔 근처에 널린 고물들 중 뭔가 쓸모있는 게 있지 않을까요?
&350 Boss, do you think that dome might be a *pleasure* dome?
&350 보스, 저 돔에 가면 *즐거운* 일이 기다리고 있을 수도 있지 않을까요?
&337 No.
&337 아니.
&351 But just in case, we're going to go in there, right?
&351 그치만 만약이란 게 있잖아요. 그리고 우린 거기 갈 거고. 맞죠?
&338 We are going in there. But not for pleasure.
&338 우린 거기 갈 거야. 하지만 즐거우려고 가는 건 아니지.
&352 For revenge!
&352 복수를 위해 가는 거죠!
&353 Boss, why don't we just blow the dome's door up? Might as well make use of the bomblet for something.
&353 보스, 그냥 돔 문을 날려버리는 건 어때요? 사실 폭탄은 이럴 때 쓰라고 있는 거잖아요.
&340 For once, Crispin, not a bad idea.
&340 처음으로, 크리스핀, 나쁘지 않은 아이디어였어.
&354 Maybe we should poke around the giant robot some more, boss.
&354 그 커다란 로봇 주변을 좀 더 뒤져보는 게 좋을 것 같아요, 보스.
&341 I thought you were scared of it.
&341 난 네가 그 로봇을 겁내는 줄 알았는데.
&355 I am! Forewarned is forearmed!
&355 당연히 겁나죠! 그치만 미리 알면 대비도 할 수 있는 거 아니겠어요!
&356 (Of course, I'm not even two-armed, but there's nothing I can do about that.)
&356 (물론 저는 뭘 대비하고 자시고 할 팔이 없긴 하지만, 뭐 그건 어쩔 수 없는 거니까요.)
&357 I bet if the giant robot opened his mouth, he'd try to eat us.
&357 그 거대 로봇이 입을 연다면, 우릴 잡아먹으려 들 지도 몰라요.
&358 Still, I kind of want to make him open his mouth.
&358 하지만, 어떻게든 그 로봇의 입을 열어보고 싶기도 하네요.
&359 Just to see him try to catch me.
&359 날 잡으려고 애쓰는 모습을 보고 싶거든요.
&360 I may not be big, but I'm fast!
&360 난 덩치는 작을 지 몰라도, 날쌔다구요!
&342 Are you through?
&342 할 말은 끝났니?
&361 Yes, sir.
&361 옙, 물론이죠.
&362 You know, boss, if the giant robot couldn't circulate air through its nose, it might have to open its mouth.
&362 "있죠, 보스, 만약 저 거대한 로봇이 코를 통해 공기를 순환시킬 수 없게 되면, 그 때는 입을 열지 않을까 싶은데요."
&343 And then try to eat you.
&343 그리곤 너를 먹어치우려고 하겠지.
&363 \"Try\" is right!
&363 절대 성공하진 못할걸요!
&364 That fingertip you just cut off is about the same size as the giant robot's nostril . . .
&364 방금 보스가 잘라낸 손가락 말인데요, 저 거대 로봇의 콧구멍에 딱 맞을 것 같거든요 . . .
&365 (Why am I even suggesting this?)
&365 (대체 내가 왜 이런 말을 하고 있죠?)
&366 That rag you keep outside engineer might work to clog one of the giant robot's nostrils, boss.
&366 기관실 밖에서 주웠던 넝마조각으로 거대 로봇의 콧구멍을 막을 수 있을 것 같은데요, 보스.
&367 That rag might work to clog one of the giant robot's nostrils, boss.
&367 그 넝마조각을 거대 로봇의 콧구멍을 막는 데 쓸 수 있을 것 같아요, 보스.
&368 We should try talking to those two weird robots some more. Maybe they know something useful.
&368 "저 이상한 두 로봇이랑 더 이야기를 해 봐야 할 것 같아요. 어쩌면 뭔가 중요한 걸 알고 있을지도 모르잖아요."
&369 I wonder if that hatch up there leads anywhere?
&369 저 위쪽의 출입구가 어디로 이어지는지 궁금하지 않아요?
&370 I wonder if that hatch inside the giant robot's throat leads anywhere?
&370 이 거대 로봇의 목구멍을 타고 내려가면 대체 뭐가 있을까요?
&371 Maybe you could use the cable to get up through the hatch? You did say it was heavy duty!
&371 "전에 주운 케이블을 타고 저 위로 올라갈 수 있지 않을까요? 그거 무진장 튼튼하다고 보스도 그랬었잖아요!"
&372 Maybe you could use the cable to get up through the hatch in the giant robot's throat? You did say it was heavy duty!
&372 "전에 주운 케이블을 타고 저 위로 올라갈 수 있지 않을까요? 그거 무진장 튼튼하다고 보스도 그랬었잖아요!"
&373 I wonder where that elevator goes?
&373 저 엘리베이터가 어디로 통해있는지 궁금한데요?
&374 You know, boss, we never did check out that elevator inside the giant robot.
&374 있죠, 보스, 우리 그 거대한 로봇 속에 있던 엘리베이터를 아직 안 살펴본 것 같은데요.
&375 You should check out that big brain, boss! It's probably twice as smart as you are!
&375 "보스, 그 커다란 두뇌를 꼭 한번 보셔야 해요! 
아마 보스보다 두 배는 더 똑똑할걸요!"
&376 It seems like the brain wants us to put in some kind of code. Good thing I have a cryptography subroutine.
"저 두뇌에 일종의 코드 같은 걸 입력해야 하는 것 같아요. 
나한테 암호 해독 서브루틴이 있는게 얼마나 다행인지 모르겠네요."
&344 No, you don't.
&344 너한테 그런 걸 넣어 준 기억은 없는데.
&377 What a strange oversight on the part of my builder.
&377 내 창조자가 그런 엄청난 실수를 저질렀다니 믿기지가 않네요.
&378 It seems like that annoying floating robot is trying to tell us something useful.
&378 저 떠다니는 성가신 로봇이 우리에게 뭔가 유용한 정보를 알려주려는 것 같아요, 보스.
&345 So it is.
&345 그런 것 같구나.
&379 Very funny, boss.
&379 완전 재밌네요, 보스.
&1024 We should keep looking for Gamma, boss.
&1024 감마를 찾아야해요, 보스.
&380 I wonder if there's some way to trap Gamma so he can't keep running away.
&380 분명 감마가 도망치지 못하게 붙들어 둘 방법이 있을 거에요.
&381 Hey, boss, do you think there's some way you can detect which monitor Gamma is in? It's not like he's playing fair himself, after all.
&381 있죠, 보스. 감마가 숨어 있는 모니터를 감지할 방법은 없을까요? 따지고 보면, 감마도 야비한 수를 쓰고 있는 건 맞잖아요.
&382 Boss, why don't you just disable some of the monitors so that Gamma can't hide?
&382 보스, 감마가 숨을 수 없게 다른 모니터들을 비활성화 시키는 건 어때요?
&346 Interesting idea.
&346 좋은 생각이야.
&383 Come on, boss, let's try the bomblet in the UNNIIC's power cradle!
&383 빨리요, 보스, 어서 이 폭탄을 UNNIIC의 파워 크래들에 장착해 보자구요!
&347 All right, all right.
&347 알았다, 알았어.
&384 How about rather than bothering me, you figure out how to fix the emergency generator?
&384 "절 귀찮게 하는 건 그만두고 비상발전기를 고칠 방법을 찾아보는 게 낫지 않을까요?"
&385 Boss, shouldn't you be focusing on putting together that energy sensor?
&385 보스, 에너지 센서를 조립할 방법을 찾는 데 집중하는 게 좋지 않을까요?
&386 Why do you keep asking me to figure things out? I'm just a *sidekick*, boss!
&386 "내가 모든 문제의 해답을 갖고 있을거라 기대하는 건 아니겠죠? 난 어디까지나 *사이드킥*일 뿐이라구요, 보스!"
&387 Okay, fine, here's an idea: you stop bothering me!
&387 좋아, 좋아요. 이렇게 하면 어떨까요: 날 가만히 내버려두기!
&388 Hm. Here's what we need to do: find parts to build another robot . . .
&388 흠. 우리가 해야 할 일은 말이죠: 부품을 찾아서 다른 로봇을 만드는 거에요.
&389 . . .and then ask *him* what to do.
&389 ...그리고나서, *걔한테* 뭘 할지 물어보는거죠.
&390 You know, boss, you never used to ask me for advice this often back before you got thrown out of the UNNIIC.
&390 "있죠, 보스, UNNIIC 밖으로 내던져지기 전의 보스는 나한테 별로 조언을 구하는 법이 없었거든요."
&391 Do you think it's possible you damaged your processor in the fall?
&391 "어쩌면 보스가 바닥에 부딪칠 때 프로세서가 고장났을 수도 있다는 생각 안 해봤어요?"
&392 I'll make you a deal: I'll solve our problems if you'll build me arms.
&392 거래를 제안하죠: 내가 문제를 해결하면, 보스가 내게 팔을 만들어 주는 건 어때요.
&393 47, boss. The answer is 47.
&393 47이에요, 보스. 답은 47이라구요.
&348 Don't you mean 42?
&348 42라고 말하려던 거 아녔어?
&394 Err, maybe.
&394 어어, 아마도요.
&395 Hop on, boss, I'll fly us to the moon!
&395 어서 올라타요, 보스, 달까지 태워다 줄테니까요!
&349 Very funny.
&349 아주 재밌구나.
&396 Boss, I think the Gospel requires you to give me a minute's peace now and then.
&396 "보스, 복음서의 말씀에 따르면 말이죠, 가끔은 나를 귀찮게 하지 않는 게 좋다고 나와있던데요."
&397 Could you please stop bothering me? I'm trying to finish this level of Zgred.
&397 절 좀 가만히 내버려 두시면 안 될까요, 보스? Zgred의 이번 레벨을 클리어하려고 하는 중이란 말이에요!
&350 What?!
&350 뭐라고?!
&398 You know, that puzzle game you installed on me when you built me.
&398 거 있잖아요, 보스가 절 만들 때 설치해뒀던 퍼즐 게임 말이에요.
&351 But --
&351 하지만 --
&399 Look, you have your puzzles, I have mine.
&399 "보스, 보스에겐 보스의 퍼즐이 있듯이, 내겐 내 퍼즐이 있는 거라구요."
&400 Don't you have something better to do, like, say, finding us a power core?
&400 분명 할 일이 있지 않았나요, 그러니까, 파워 코어 찾기 같은?
&401 We should definitely explore the cliff-side arcology next.
&401 다음엔 꼭 절벽 근처에 있던 생태도시를 탐험해 보자구요.
&352 The *what*?
&352 *뭘* 탐험하자고?
&402 Oh. I guess we haven't found that yet.
&402 어. 그건 아직 안 찾았었나 보네요.
&403 I'm not listening!
&403 잘 안들리는데요!
&404 ABORT. RETRY. FAIL.
&404 임무중지. 재시도. 실패.
&405 Definitely \"fail.\" Please don't retry.
&405 \"실패\"라고 했음. 재시도를 시도하지 마십시오.
&406 Danger! Danger!
&406 위험! 위험!
&407 So, boss, did I ever tell you about the writing on your back?
&407 근데, 보스, 보스 등판에 뭐라고 써 있는지 내가 얘기했던가요?
&352 The what?
&352 뭐라고?
&408 Oh, never mind.
&408 오, 신경쓰지 마세요.
&409 Hey, boss, remember the time I brought that magnet back to the UNNIIC and accidentally wiped part of your memory?
&409 저기 보스, 제가 UNNIIC에 자석을 가져와서 실수로 보스의 기억을 좀 지워버렸던 사건 기억해요?
&353 No . . .
&353 아니...
&410 Yeah -- aren't magnets great?
&410 그렇구나 -- 자석은 정말 대단하다니까!
&411 One of these days, boss, you're gonna run out of pockets, and then you're gonna wish you'd built me some arms.
&411 보스, 언젠가 주머니 공간이 모자랄 때면, 그땐 보스도 분명 내게 팔을 달아줄걸 하고 후회할 거에요.
&354 No, I'm going to wish that I'd sewn more pockets into my cloak.
&354 아니, 내 옷에 주머니를 더 달아둘 걸 하고 후회하겠지.
&413 Boss, did you ever think that if you'd made me a cone, rather than a cylinder, I'd have a \"floating point\"?
&413 Boss, did you ever think that if you'd made me a cone, rather than a cylinder, I'd have a \"floating point\"?
&355 I'm fairly certain you will never have a point, Crispin.
&355 I'm fairly certain you will never have a point, Crispin.
&414 Sometimes, I think to myself, \"Maybe *you* should be in charge.\"
&414 Sometimes, I think to myself, \"Maybe *you* should be in charge.\"
&356 Oh really?
&356 그래? 진짜로?
&415 No.
&415 아니요.
&1025 Boss, when we find Scraper, are you going to blow him up?
&1025 보스, 만약 스크래퍼를 발견하거든 그 놈을 날려버릴 생각인가요?
&416 Boss, when we find that big robot, are you going to blow him up?
&416 보스, 만약 그 커다란 로봇을 발견하거든 놈을 날려버릴 생각인가요?
&357 I doubt it.
&357 글쎄다.
&417 Oh, so you're just going to *reason* with him?
&417 와우, 그럼 마주앉아서 차분히 설득할 예정인가 보군요?
&358 On second thought, maybe I *will* blow him up.
&358 다시 생각해보니 말인데, 놈을 날려버려야 할 것 같아.
&418 Boss, do you remember what your prior versions were like?
&418 보스, 보스의 이전 버전들이 어땠는지 기억나요?
&359 No. I've told you a hundred times, there are a lot of corrupt sectors in my memory files.
&359 아니. 이미 수백번이나 말해줬잖니. 내 기억파일엔 수많은 손상된 섹터들이 있다고.
&419 Maybe Horatio version 4 was nice. . .
&419 호라시오 버전 4는 상냥했을지도...
&420 You know, the moon is really quite lovely.
&420 그거 알아요? 달은 참 사랑스러워요.
&360 Crispin, are you feeling all right?
&360 크리스핀, 어디 아픈 거냐?
&421 What, do I have to be cynical *all* the time?
&421 뭐, 나는 *항상* 냉소적이어야 해요?
&361 According to line 11781 of your personality routine . . . .
&361 네 성격루틴 11781번 째 줄에 따르면...
&422 Forget it. The moon looks like a big zero, representing our progress.
&422 됐어요. 달은 마치 커다란 0처럼 보이네요. 흡사 우리들의 진척상황처럼 말이죠.
&423 Boss, can I hold the plasma torch?
&423 보스, 제가 플라즈마 토치를 들어도 돼요?
&362 No.
&362 안 돼.
&424 Just to look at it!
&424 그냥 보기만 할 건데!
&363 No.
&363 안 돼.
&425 Pleeeeease?
&425 제에에에에발?
&364 No.
&364 안 돼.
&427 You know, boss, I'm pretty sure that if I build myself a robot companion, it's going to be a sleek gynoid, not a wisecracking sidekick.
&427 그거 알아요 보스? 만일 날 위한 로봇 친구를 만든다면, 그건 아마 매끈한 가이노이드가 될 거에요. 재치있는 말을 해대는 사이드킥이 아니라.
&247 You are unsuitable for companionship, Crispin.
&247 넌 그리 좋은 친구가 못 된단다, 크리스핀.
&248 Least of all with a sleek gynoid.
&248 특히 매끈한 가이노이드랑은 더더욱.
&1026 Aww, you're just getting jealous!
&1026 저런, 질투하는군요!
&428 Boss, since you programmed me, you can predict my every action, right?
&428 보스, 보스가 날 프로그램했으니까 말인데, 보스는 내가 하는 모든 행동을 예측할 수 있죠?
&365 No; most of what you do is governed by a random number generator.
&365 아니. 네가 하는 대부분의 행동들은 난수 생성 루틴에 의해 결정된다.
&429 Mmm . . . sprockets . . .
&429 음. . . 기계들이란. . .
&430 Thou art truly lame, Horatio.
&430 그대는 실로 한심하다네, 호라시오.
&366 What?
&366 뭐라고?
&431 Just practicing my Ever-Faithful imitation. Forsooth!
&431 그냥 에버-페이스풀 흉내내기 연습 중이었어요. 정말이지!
&432 You know, boss, I'm still just grateful we didn't get eaten by Goliath.
&432 있죠, 보스. 다시 생각해 봐도 우리가 골리앗에게 잡아먹히지 않은 건 정말 다행이다 싶어요
&433 You know, boss, I'm still just grateful we didn't get eaten by that giant robot.
&433 있죠, 보스. 다시 생각해 봐도 우리가 그 커다란 로봇에게 잡아먹히지 않은 건 정말 다행이다 싶어요
&434 Boss, I'm pretty sure the lesson of all this is that if you're going to build a floating robot, you should give him claws that shoot lasers.
&434 보스, 이 모든 일로부터 얻을 수 있는 교훈이 있다면 다름아닌 '공중부양 로봇을 만들 거라면, 그에게 레이저를 쏠 수 있는 집게손을 줘라'일 거에요.
&367 So you can go steal power cores?
&367 파워 코어를 훔쳐올 수 있도록 말이지?
&435 Power cores, and fem-bots.
&435 파워 코어 뿐이겠어요, 여자 로봇도 얻을 수 있을 걸요.
&436 *humming*
&436 *흥얼흥얼*
&368 Agh, I just got that song out of my head!
&368 아으, 이 노래가 자꾸 저절로 생각이 난다구요!
&437 Oops.
&437 이런.
&438 Horus. . . .
&438 호루스 . . .
&369 Stop that.
&369 그만.
&439 Boss, what about, rather than arms, you give me a grappling hook and a harpoon?
&439 보스, 나한테 팔 대신에 갈고리손과 작살을 달아주는 건 어때요?
&370 That wouldn't be practical.
&370 그건 별로 실용적이지 않을 것 같은데.
&440 Who said anything about practicality?
&440 실용성 같은 걸 누가 신경 쓴다고 그래요?
&441 Are we there yet?
&441 언제쯤 도착해요?
&371 Are we *where* yet?
&371 *어디* 얘기하는 거야?
&442 Wherever it is we're going.
&442 어디든지 우리가 가고 있는 데요.
&372 No.
&372 아직이야.
&443 Ahh, home sweet home.
&443 아아, 즐겁고 편안한 우리집.
&444 Boss, don't you think it's a fire hazard to have all of those books piled up like that?
&444 보스, 이렇게 책을 쌓아두면 불이 났을 때 위험하지 않겠어요?
&373 How would they catch fire?
&373 여기에 누가 불을 붙일 거라는 소리 같은데?
&445 *whistling*
&445 *휘파람*
&446 Boss, why do you need a bed, anyway?
&446 그건 그렇고 보스, 보스에게 침대가 필요하긴 한 거에요?
&447 Can't you just shut down on the floor?
&447 그냥 바닥에 누워서 전원을 끄면 되는 거 아녜요?
&374 The bed has always been here. I just assumed one of my prior versions built it.
&374 침대는 예전부터 여기에 있었어. 아마 내 이전 버전이 만든 게 아닐까 싶고.
&448 That's the lamest explanation ever.
&448 그야말로 도무지 납득이 안 가는 설명이네요.
&449 Boss, are you ever going to do anything about that oil leak?
&449 보스, 저기 기름이 새는 부분을 고칠 생각은 있는 거죠?
&375 Yes.
&375 물론이지.
&376 After we recover our power core.
&376 우리가 파워 코어를 찾은 다음에 말이야.
&450 Now who's making excuses?
&450 이제보니 변명하기 좋아하는 건 나뿐만이 아녔던 모양인데요?
&451 Hey, boss, did you ever hear the one about the telescope and the poop-deck?
&451 있잖아요, 보스, 혹시 망원경과 갑판에 얽힌 이야기 들어본 적 있어요?
&377 No, and I don't intend to now, either.
&377 아니, 그리고 궁금하지도 않구나.
&452 Boss, is it okay if I sleep in the cradle until we have a new power core?
&452 보스, 새로운 파워 코어를 찾을 때까지 크래들에서 자고 있어도 되요?
&378 No.
&378 아니.
&453 One robot's junk is another robot's treasure!
&453 어떤 로봇이 보기엔 쓰레기지만, 다른 로봇이 볼 땐 보물일 수도 있는 거죠!
&454 If only I were another robot.
&454 물론 내가 바로 그 '다른 로봇'인지는 또 다른 문제지만.
&455 Ooohhh, spooky!
&455 우우, 무서워라!
&456 The UNNIIC looks . . . dead, boss.
&456 UNNIIC이 마치 . . . 죽은 것 같네요, 보스.
&379 Just sleeping.
&379 그냥 잠든 거야.
&457 Just count to a thousand, Crispin. He's not going to eat you. You're too fast for him.
&457 천까지 숫자를 세는 거야, 크리스핀. 저 녀석은 널 잡아먹지 못해. 너는 무진장 빠르다구.
&380 Are you talking to yourself?
&380 지금 혼잣말 하는 거니?
&458 No.
&458 아뇨.
&459 Hey, boss, he's got a bigger brain than you do!
&459 봐요, 보스, 이 녀석은 보스보다 훨씬 큰 두뇌를 가졌다구요!
&460 If that bot buzzes at me one more time, I'm going to swat him.
&460 만약 저 녀석이 나한테 한번만 더 징징대면, 가서 한 대 때려줄 거에요.
&381 With what?
&381 뭘로?
&461 Oh, go crash yourself.
&461 오, 그렇게 따지고 들지 마요.
&462 I can't believe you convinced me to stand inside a giant robot's mouth.
&462 내가 보스를 따라서 이 커다란 로봇의 입 안으로 들어왔다는 게 믿기지가 않네요.
&463 This isn't exactly what I imagined the robot's stomach would look like.
&463 내가 상상했던 로봇의 위장이랑은 조금 다르게 생긴 것 같네요.
&464 It seems like there should be kilns and gears and things, not monitors!
&464 가마라던가 톱니바퀴, 뭐 그런게 있어야 한다구요, 모니터 말구요!
&382 For the last time, Crispin, robots don't have stomachs.
&382 마지막으로 말하는 건데, 크리스핀, 로봇에게는 위장이 없어.
&465 Where do you think we are? His lungs?
&465 그럼 우리가 어디 있는 건데요? 폐 안에?
&466 Boss, do we really have to sit around next to a giant bomb?
&466 보스, 우리가 꼭 이 거대한 폭탄 옆에 있어야만 할까요?
&467 We're nearly there, boss! I can almost taste it!
&467 거의 다 왔어요, 보스! 냄새가 나는 것 같다구요!
&383 You don't have taste sensors, Crispin.
&383 넌 냄새를 맡을 수 없잖니, 크리스핀.
&468 I said \"almost,\" didn't I?
&468 그래서 "나는 것 같다"고 했잖아요, 안 그래요?
&469 I told you there was a train to Metropol.
&469 메트로폴로 가는 기차가 있을 거라고 내가 말했었잖아요.
&470 I've gotta say, this is probably the coolest place we've been yet. Guns! Tanks! Broken-down robots!
&470 아마 여긴 우리가 와 본 장소 중 제일 멋진 장소일 거에요. 총도 있고! 탱크! 부서진 로봇까지!
&471 Boss, does it ever bother you that the only thing attaching the UNNIIC to its tail is a cable?
&471 보스, UNNIIC의 선미에 달려있는 게 케이블 밖에 없다는 거, 좀 이상하지 않아요?
&384 No.
&384 아니.
&472 I think I'm starting to figure out how this ship must have crashed . . .
&472 어떻게 이 함선이 추락하게 된 건지 슬슬 알 것도 같네요 . . .
&473 Boss, do you hear a clicking sound?
&473 보스, 딸깍거리는 소리 들었어요?
&474 Okay, okay, give me a second . . . .
&474 알았어요, 알았다구요, 잠깐만 있어봐요...
&475 Something's coming to me!
&475 기막힌 아이디어가 떠오르려는 참이니까요!
&476 Err. . . .
&476 어어...
&477 Actually, I have no idea.
&477 사실, 아무 생각이 안 나네요.
&478 Boss, we need to make a rocketship.
&478 보스, 우린 로켓을 만들어야 해요.
&385 No, Crispin, we don't.
&385 아니, 크리스핀. 그런 일은 없을거야.
&479 But if we did, we could harness the power of a black hole. . . .
&479 하지만 우리가 로켓을 만든다면, 그 다음엔 블랙홀의 동력을 이용해서...
&480 DIPUTS SI OITAROH.
&480 야이청멍 는오시라호.
&481 Hey, you thought it was funny when that stupid brain-bot did it.
&481 그 멍청한 브레인-봇이 했을 땐 보스도 재밌다고 생각했었잖아요.
&387 No, I didn't.
&387 아니, 안 그랬어.
&482 Well, neither did I.
&482 흠, 나도요.
&483 Okay, okay, I think I know what to do.
&483 알았어요, 알았어. 우리가 뭘 해야 하는지 알 것 같아요.
&484 But I'll give it to you in code!
&484 암호로 만들어서 알려드릴게요!
&485 After all, I don't want to spoil the surprise.
&485 왜냐하면, 흥을 깨고 싶지는 않으니까요.
&486 Fabba sloo 135, gabba sloo 122. Mabba --
&486 파바 슬루 135, 가바 슬루 122, 마바 --
&388 Crispin, that's not code, that's just gibberish.
&388 크리스핀, 그건 암호가 아니잖아. 그냥 아무 말이나 지껄이는 거지.
&487 Aww, you always ruin everything, boss.
&487 어우, 보스는 항상 그런 식이야.
&488 Boss, did you ever consider that sometimes I just run out of clever ideas?
&488 보스, 가끔은 아무리 나라도 명쾌한 아이디어가 떠오르지 않을 때가 있다는 거 알고 있어요?
&489 Sorry, boss, I've got sand in my audio receptors. I'll let you know when it's out.
&489 "미안해요, 보스. 제 청각 장치에 모래가 들어간 모양인데요. 다 털어내고 나면 말씀드릴게요."
&490 Boss, sometimes a builder just has to let his creation figure things out for himself.
&490 보스, 무릇 창조자라면 자신의 피조물이 스스로 해낼 때까지 인내심을 갖고 지켜봐줘야 하는 법이에요.
&389 I'm your builder, Crispin.
&389 네 창조자는 나잖니, 크리스핀.
&491 I know.  That's what makes this particularly sad.
&491 알아요. 그래서 작금의 사태가 더욱 슬프게 느껴지는거죠.
&492 What would Man do, boss?
&492 인간이라면 어떻게 하셨겠어요, 보스?
&493 By my calculations, boss, you've got 99 problems, but a glitch isn't one of them.
&493 "내 계산에 의하면요, 보스, 보스에겐 99개의 문제가 있지만, 불행인지 다행인지 버그 탓인 건 없네요."
&494 Boss, if you had to choose between letting your builder die a horrible death or stealing his plasma torch, which would you do?
&494 "보스, 만약 보스의 창조자가 처참하게 파괴되는 거랑, 그의 플라즈마 토치를 훔치는 것 중 하나를 선택해야 한다면, 어느 쪽을 선택하시겠어요?"
&390 Crispin, stealing my plasma torch isn't going to save me from destruction.
&390 크리스핀, 정말 그런 상황에 처한다면 내 플라즈마 토치를 훔친다고 해도 별로 큰 도움은 되지 않을 거야.
&495 It was a hypothetical question! I wasn't talking about us!
&495 "그냥 가정을 해 보자는 얘기죠! 우리 얘길 하는 게 아니라구요!"
&496 Boss, do you think the voice of Metropol would sing me to sleep if we went to the city?
&496 보스, 우리가 메트로폴에 간다면 그 '메트로폴의 목소리'가 나한테 자장가를 불러줄까요?
&391 No.
&391 아니.
&497 So why exactly were you building an energy sensor, anyway?
&497 그래서, 대체 왜 에너지 센서를 만들고 있었던거에요?
&392 I wanted to find other robots.
&392 다른 로봇들을 찾고 싶었어.
&498 Oh.
&498 오.
&499 But then you made me!
&499 하지만 보스는 날 만들었잖아요!
&393 And then I changed my mind.
&393 그러고나니 마음이 바뀌더군.
&500 I feel like we're really in the dark here.
&500 우리 지금 그야말로 앞이 깜깜한 상황이네요.
&394 Any bright ideas?
&394 반짝 떠오르는 아이디어라도?
&501 Err, I was being literal . . . .
&501 어어, 그냥 말이 그렇단 뜻이었는데...
&502 Boss, I think you left your datapouch lying on the ground after that robot threw you out of the ship.
&502 보스, 그 로봇이 보스를 밖으로 내던져버릴 때 떨어뜨린 데이터파우치를 아직 안 주운 것 같은데요.
&1027 Boss, if I squint really hard, I can see how this room must've looked when everything was brand new.
&1027 보스, 제가 눈을 진짜 가늘게 뜨면요, 모든게 새거였을 때 여기가 어땠을지 보여요.
&1724 Oh?
&1724 정말?
&1028 Yeah.
&1028 정말이라니깐요.
&1029 It was lame back then, too.
&1029 그 당시에도 지루하게 생겼었어요.
&1030 You know, boss, this seems like it would be a *really* great place to have a party.
&1030 있죠, 보스, 여긴 *정말로* 파티를 열기에 적합한 장소가 아녔을까 싶어요.
&1031 They really roll out the red carpet for visitors, huh, boss?
&1031 손님들을 위해서 레드 카펫을 쫙 깔아뒀으니까요, 그쵸, 보스?
&249 Trains once ran through this station every six minutes.
&249 한때 기차들이 이 역에 정확히 6분에 한 번씩 정차하고는 했었다.
&250 Now, MetroMind cannot even maintain her own rail system.
&250 하지만 이제, 메트로마인드는 본연의 임무조차 다하지 못하고 있군.
&251 Every time I walk through this station, I am reminded of the folly of war.
&251 이 정거장을 거닐 때 마다 항상 전쟁의 어리석음에 대해 생각하게 되는군.
&252 Here is proof beyond any doubt why law, and law alone, should possess the power to destroy.
&252 이것이야말로 왜 법이, 그리고 오직 법만이 파괴할 권한을 지녀야 하는지에 대한 명징한 증거이지.
&1032 Or . . . maybe *no one* should possess that power?
&1032 또는 . . . *아무도* 그런 권한을 가져서는 안 되는 게 아닐까요?
&253 Don't be naive, Crispin.
&253 순진한 소리 말게, 크리스핀.
&1034 Shouldn't we go find that big tower, boss?
&1034 저 큰 탑으로 가 봐야 하지 않을까요?
&1033 You know, boss, maybe we should go talk to that annoying robot who keeps shouting at us?
&1033 "있잖아요, 보스, 저 쪽에서 계속 우리한테 소리치던 성가신 로봇이랑 얘기해보는 건 어떨까요?"
&1035 I wonder whether Leopold has anything worth trading for?
&1035 레오폴드가 뭔가 교환할 만한 가치가 있는 물건을 갖고 있지 않을까요?
&1036 (Like, say, an arm made of solid palladium.)
&1036 (그러니까, 예를 들어, 튼튼한 솔리듐제 팔이라던가요.)
&2500 I wonder whether that robot has anything worth trading for?
&2500 저 로봇이 뭔가 교환할 만한 가치가 있는 물건을 갖고 있지 않을까요?
&1037 I've got a feeling I'm gonna regret this, boss, but do you think maybe we should try scrounging in the Underworks?
&1037 "이 말을 한 걸 후회하게 될 것 같단 예감이 들지만요, 보스, 우리 언더워크에 뭔가 건질만한 게 없는지 찾아봐야 하지 않을까요?"
&1038 Maybe this is obvious to you, boss, but you might want to see if we can get that crowbar of Leopold's.
&1038 보스, 레오폴드가 갖고 있던 쇠지렛대를 얻을 방법을 찾아보는 게 좋을 것 같은데요. 이미 보스도 그렇게 생각하고 있었겠지만요.
&1039 I bet we could use it to pry up the manhole cover.
&1039 그걸 이용하면 맨홀 뚜껑을 열 수 있을 거에요.
&1040 (And by \"we,\" I mean, \"you.\")
&1040 (그리고 "우리가"라는 건, 사실은 "보스가" 해야한단 뜻이죠.)
&1041 (Seeing as how I have no arms.)
&1041 (보시다시피 나한텐 팔이 없으니까요.)
&1042 (Or interest in visiting the Underworks.)
&1042 (언더워크에 대한 흥미도 전혀 없고 말이죠.)
&1043 Pretty cool how that little crystal is still shiny even after the whole energy sensor burned up, huh, boss?
&1043 에너지 센서가 불타버렸어도 이 작은 크리스탈은 계속 빛나고 있는거 꽤 멋지지 않아요, 보스?
&1044 Maybe I'm just a sucker for flashing neon lights, boss, but I kinda want to check out that information kiosk.
&1044 그냥 제가 번쩍이는 네온불빛을 보면 사족을 못 쓰는 걸 수도 있지만요 보스, 저 정보 검색대를 한번 조사해보고 싶어요.
&1045 Let's look around some more, boss: I'm in the mood for some new browns and reds.
&1045 좀 더 둘러보는 건 어때요, 보스? 새로운 고철더미를 찾아보는 것도 좋을 것 같아서요.
&1046 Sounds like we need to get into the courthouse and talk to Arbiter.
&1046 법원 안으로 들어가 아비터와 대화를 나눠봐야 할 것 같아요.
&1047 We've gotta find a way to clear the line to get into the courthouse.
&1047 법원으로 향하는 이 줄을 지나갈 방법을 찾아봐야 겠는데요.
&1048 Because, honestly, I refuse to wait in line.
&1048 왜냐면요, 솔직히, 난 줄 서는 건 딱 질색이거든요.
&1049 Not even for a power core.
&1049 파워 코어를 준다고 해도 싫구요.
&1050 Not even for a gynoid.
&1050 여자 로봇을 만날 수 있대도 싫다구요.
&1051 Well . . .
&1051 흠...
&1052 . . . maybe for a gynoid.
&1052 ...여자 로봇을 만나기 위해서라면 기다릴 수 있을지도.
&1053 There's gotta be a key for the courthouse door somewhere, boss!
&1053 법원 문 열쇠가 어딘가 있을거에요, 보스!
&1054 Hey! I wonder whether that \"Clarity\" robot might have a key to the courthouse.
&1054 맞아! 그 클래리티 라는 로봇에게 법원 열쇠가 있을지도 모르겠군요.
&1055 Hey! I bet Clarity has a key to the courthouse!
&1055 맞아! 클래리티에겐 법원 열쇠가 있을게 분명해요.
&1056 We should look around and see if there's a way to lower that drawbridge, boss.
&1056 우선 저 도개교를 내려놓을 만한 방법을 찾는 게 좋을 것 같은데요, 보스.
&1057 Someone around here's gotta know something about how to get that bridge to go down, boss.
&1057 이 근처에 있는 누군가가 어떻게 저 다리를 내려놓을 지에 대해 뭔가 알고 있을지도 몰라요, 보스.
&1058 Seems like we've just gotta figure out what Primer's real name is, and then we'll be able to lower that drawbridge.
&1058 프라이머의 진짜 이름만 알면 저 도개교를 내릴 수 있을거 같아요.
&1060 You know, boss, given that all of 187th's other brothers have numerical indicators, the same thing has to be true of Primer.
&1060 그거 알아요, 보스? 187호기의 다른 모든 형제들이 번호로 된 식별지표를 가지고 있는걸로 봤을때, 분명 프라이머도 마찬가지일 꺼에요.
&1059 We just need to figure out what his number is, and, presto, down comes the drawbridge!
&1059 걔 번호가 뭔지만 알아내면, 짜잔! 도개교가 내려오는거죠!
&1061 Hey, boss, didn't 187th say that Primer came off 50 slots before him?
&1061 저기 보스, 187호기가 프라이머는 자기보다 50번째 슬롯 더 먼저 떨어져나왔다고 하지 않았나요?
&1062 That would make Primer's number 137!
&1062 그렇다면 프라이머의 번호는 137이겠네요!
&1063 Which, I might point out, fits onto the console keypad!
&1063 그리고 그건 도개교의 콘솔에 입력하면 딱 들어맞을 거에요!
&1064 I wouldn't mind chatting up that Clarity gynoid again, boss.
&1064 그 클래리티란 여자 로봇과 다시 얘기해봐도 좋을 것 같은데요, 보스.
&1065 Hey, boss, let's go chat up Clarity!
&1065 있죠, 보스. 클래리티와 얘기하러 가요!
&1066 Maybe that big warbot on the courthouse steps has something to tell us.
&1066 어쩌면 법원 계단에 있던 커다란 전투 로봇이 우리에게 뭔가 말해줄 지도 몰라요.
&1067 Like, for example, where we can get some guns!
&1067 그러니까, 예를 들자면, 총이 어디 있는지 같은 거요!
&1068 See who steals our power core THEN!
&1068 그 다음엔 우리 파워 코어를 훔친 녀석을 쫓아가는 거죠!
&1069 Let's go talk to 187th again!
&1069 187호랑 다시 얘기하러 가요!
&1447 Why?
&1447 왜?
&1070 Because I like hearing someone say \"sir\" even more frequently than I say \"boss,\" boss.
&1070 왜냐면 그 친구가 내가 "보스"라고 말하는것보다 더 많이 "선생님"이라고 말하는 걸 듣는 게 좋거든요.
&1071 Don't you think we should go check out where 187th shot up the tower?
&1071 187호가 탑에 대고 쏴제꼈던 곳을 살펴보러 가는 게 어떨까요?
&1072 Maybe he blasted a way in for us?
&1072 어쩌면 우리를 위해 길을 내 뒀을지도 모르잖아요?
&1073 There's got to be someone -- or some*thing* -- that can help us figure out how to get 187th out of his fine.
&1073 분명 187호가 벌금을 내지 않아도 될 방법을 알려줄 누군가 -- 혹은 *무언가*--가 있을 거에요.
&1074 Hey, boss, a light bulb just went off for me!
&1074 Hey, boss, a light bulb just went off for me!
&1075 A big, neon light bulb that says: \"INFO\"!
&1075 A big, neon light bulb that says: \"INFO\"!
&1076 I bet that kiosk would have some information about local laws.
&1076 저 정보 검색대에 여기 법에 대한 정보가 있을 게 분명해요.
&1077 You know, boss, you never did pick up that printout from the information kiosk.
&1077 그러고보니, 보스, 아까 정보 검색대에서 나온 출력물을 챙기는 걸 깜빡하지 않았나요?
&1078 We should see if there's anything in that printout that might be relevant to 187th's case, boss.
&1078 저 출력물에 187호를 도울 방법이 있을지 한번 살펴봐야 할 것 같아요, 보스.
&1079 It really seems like 187th doesn't have to pay anything, boss, given that he barely damaged the tower.
&1079 내 생각엔 187호가 벌금을 낼 필요는 없을 것 같아요, 보스. 왜냐면 탑엔 거의 아무런 손상도 없이 말짱했잖아요.
&1080 We should probably go tell him so.
&1080 가서 그 사실을 알려줘야 할 것 같아요.
&1081 We still haven't talked to that floating robot over by the courthouse sign, boss.
&1081 우리 아직 법원 앞에 있던 떠다니는 로봇에게 말을 안 걸어본 것 같은데요, 보스.
&1082 There's gotta be some other way to communicate with that floating robot.
&1082 저 떠다니는 로봇에게 말을 걸 방법이 분명히 있을 거에요.
&1083 Maybe that floating robot communicates on something other than an audible frequency?
&1083 어쩌면 저 로봇은 들리지 않는 무언가로 의사소통하는 게 아닐까요?
&1084 Is there anything else you could ask Gimbal, boss?
&1084 짐벌에게 물어볼 게 더 있지 않을까요, 보스?
&1085 Sounds like we need to go talk to Leopold about Gimbal's motor.
&1085 짐벌의 모터에 관해 레오폴드에게 가서 물어봐야 할 것 같네요.
&1086 So we've gotta find some big motor to trade with Leopold?
&1086 그럼, 이제 레오폴드에게 가져다 줄 커다란 모터를 찾으러 가야겠네요?
&1087 Joy.
&1087 완전 신난다.
&1088 I'm pretty sure the best place to find a big motor is gonna be somewhere in the Underworks, boss.
&1088 내 생각엔 언더워크 외에 커다란 모터가 있을법한 장소는 없을 것 같은데요, 보스.
&1089 Boss, let's trade this car engine to Leopold already!
&1089 보스, 이 자동차 엔진을 레오폴드에게 가져가죠!
&1090 Even *I'm* getting tired from you carrying it around.
&1090 보스가 그걸 들고다니는 걸 보니 *내가* 다 피곤하네요.
&1091 Time to give Gimbal his motor back, right, boss?
&1091 짐벌에게 모터를 돌려줄 때가 된 것 같네요, 보스.
&1092 We should talk to those two snappy robots outside the courthouse, boss.
&1092 법원 밖에 서 있는 저 말쑥한 두 로봇에게 말을 걸어보는 게 좋겠어요, 보스.
&1093 You know, boss, I just liked hearing Oswald and Cornelius bicker.
&1093 있죠, 보스, 오스왈드와 코넬리우스가 투닥대는 걸 듣는 건 꽤 재밌던데요.
&1094 Let's go talk to them some more.
&1094 가서 좀 더 이야기를 나눠 보는 건 어때요?
&1095 There's gotta be someone in this city who can judge Oswald and Cornelius's case!
&1095 도시 안에 오스왈드와 코넬리우스의 사건을 해결해줄 수 있는 누군가가 분명 있을거에요!
&1096 Hey, boss, do you think that Clarity might be able to judge Oswald and Cornelius's case?
&1096 있죠, 보스, 클래리티라면 오스왈드와 코넬리우스의 사건을 해결해줄 수 있지 않을까요?
&1097 Are you ever gonna tell Oswald and Cornelius the verdict, boss?
&1097 오스왈드와 코넬리우스에게 판결을 말해줄 작정인가요, 보스?
&1098 Time to go pay a visit to Arbiter, boss!
&1098 아비터를 만나러 갈 시간이에요, 보스!
&1099 After all the work we did to get into the courthouse, boss, maybe we should poke around some more.
&1099 법원에 들어오려고 무진장 많은 일들을 했잖아요, 보스. 좀 더 둘러보는 게 좋을 것 같아요.
&1100 There's gotta be some way to get a better look at that robot in the corner.
&1100 There's gotta be some way to get a better look at that robot in the corner.
&1101 There's gotta be some way to get a better look at that robot in the courthouse
&1101 There's gotta be some way to get a better look at that robot in the courthouse
&1102 Boss, I think the lamp might \"shed a little light\" on that broken-down robot in the corner.
&1102 Boss, I think the lamp might \"shed a little light\" on that broken-down robot in the corner.
&1103 Boss, I think the lamp might \"shed a little light\" on that broken-down robot in the courthouse.
&1103 Boss, I think the lamp might \"shed a little light\" on that broken-down robot in the courthouse.
&1104 Get it?
&1104 Get it?
&772 I got it.
&772 알아들었어.
&1106 Boss, we've gotta figure out what happened here!
&1106 보스, 여기서 무슨 일이 있었는지 알아내야죠!
&1107 Boss, we've gotta figure out what happened in the courthouse!
&1107 보스, 법원에서 무슨 일이 있었는지 알아내야죠!
&1108 Is there some way to, you know, retrieve Charity's memories?
&1108 그 뭐냐, 채리티의 메모리를 복구할 방법이 있을까요?
&1109 Preferably without me having to look while you reach into her head.
&1109 가급적이면 보스가 그의 머리 속에 손을 집어넣는 걸 안 봐도 되는 방향으로요.
&1110 Boss, didn't Leopold have a memory reader for sale?
&1110 보스, 레오폴드가 메모리 리더기를 팔고 있지 않았던가요?
&1111 Maybe we could use that to get at Charity's memories?
&1111 어쩌면 그걸 사용해서 채리티의 메모리를 읽을 수 있을지도 몰라요!
&1112 You know, boss, that hat seems pretty old and fancy.
&1112 있죠, 보스, 그 모자 상당히 오래 된 데다가 고급스러워 보이는데요.
&1113 You know, boss, that coin seems pretty old and fancy.
&1113 있죠, 보스, 그 동전 상당히 오래 된 데다가 고급스러워 보이는데요.
&1114 Maybe we could trade it to Leopold for the memory access device?
&1114 그거랑 메모리 접근 장치를 교환할 수 있지 않을까요?
&1115 Boss, we've gotta find a way to distract Scraper so we can get out of here!
&1115 보스, 스크래퍼의 주의를 돌려서 여기서 나갈 방법을 찾아야해요!
&1116 There has to be *something* in here we can use to create a diversion, boss!
&1116 여기 어딘가에 스크래퍼의 주의를 끄는 데 쓸 만한 *무언가*가 분명 있을 거에요, 보스!
&1117 You know, boss, I think Clarity would appreciate it if we told her what happened at the courthouse.
&1117 있죠, 보스, 제 생각엔 법원에서 무슨 일이 있었는지 클래리티에게 말해준다면 그녀라도 조금은 고마워하지 않을까요?
&1118 You know, boss, since we're combing this city anyway, maybe we should look for your Gospel while we're at it.
&1118 있죠, 보스. 어차피 이 도시를 샅샅이 뒤질 거라면, 보스의 복음서도 한번 찾아보는 게 좋을 것 같은데요.
&1766 How can we possibly find it?
&1766 그걸 찾는게 가능하기는 할까?
&254 Contraband is thrown into the Underworks.
&254 밀수품은 곧장 언더워크로 던져진다.
&255 Recovering your book is simply a matter of following the run-off currents.
&255 자네의 책은 지하수로를 뒤져 보면 의외로 간단히 찾을 수 있을 지도 모르지.
&1119 Delightful.
&1119 멋지네요.
&1120 The Gospel's gotta be somewhere in the Underworks, boss. Let's keep looking.
&1120 복음서는 분명 언더워크 어딘가에 있을거에요, 보스. 계속 찾아보자구요.
&1121 Boss, I noticed some junk floating alongside the bridge near the Factor facilities.
&1121 보스, 팩터 시설로 통하는 다리 옆쪽에 떠 있는 쓰레기가 눈에 띄는데요.
&1122 Maybe we could find some contraband there!
&1122 어쩌면 저기서 내던져진 밀수품이 있을지도 몰라요!
&1123 Boss, looking at that junk floating alongside the bridge!
&1123 보스! 저 다리 옆에 떠 있는 쓰레기를 좀 봐요!
&1124 Maybe we should poke around that floating junk some more, boss.
&1124 저 물 위에 뜬 쓰레기를 좀 뒤져봐야 할 것 같아요, 보스.
&1125 It's like bobbing for treasures!
&1125 마치 보물 건져내기 같네요!
&1126 As long as we're running down descendants of these Council robots, maybe we should go talk to Oswald.
&1126 As long as we're running down descendants of these Council robots, maybe we should go talk to Oswald.
&1127 After all, he's a \"Factorbuilt\" robot.
&1127 어쨌든간에, 그는 \"팩터빌트"\ 로봇이잖아요.
&1128 Maybe Leopold knows something about Steeple, boss, given that his fabrinymic is \"Steeplebuilt.\"
&1128 어쩌면 레오폴드가 스티플에 대해 뭔가 알 지도 몰라요, 보스. 그의 성씨는 \"스티플빌트\" 잖아요.
&1129 There has to be some way to get Leopold to admit that he knows Steeple, boss.
&1129 분명 레오폴드가 스티플을 안다는 걸 인정하게 만들 방법이 있을 거에요, 보스.
&256 Confronting an uncooperative witness with physical evidence is often an effective tactic.
&256 비협조적인 증인에게 물리적 증거를 제시하는 것은 꽤 효과적인 전략이다.
&1130 Err, yeah, what she said.
&1130 어, 그렇죠, 그녀가 말한 대로요.
&1131 Boss, what about showing your Gospel to Leopold?
&1131 보스, 보스의 복음서를 레오폴드에게 보여주는 건 어때요?
&1132 Maybe you guys can bond over it?
&1132 그걸 계기로 좀 가까워질 수도 있잖아요?
&1133 You know, boss, if we had the Gospel, maybe you and Leopold could bond over it!
&1133 있죠, 보스. 만약 우리에게 복음서가 있었다면, 그걸 계기로 레오폴드와 좀 말을 터볼 수 있었을텐데요!
&1134 So we need to find some disciple of Memorious, right, boss?
&1134 이제 우린 메모리우스의 로봇을 찾아야 하는 거죠, 보스?
&257 As far as I know, Memorious built no robots.
&257 내가 아는 한, 메모리우스는 로봇을 만든 일이 없다.
&258 His only legacy is the network of information kiosks distributed throughout Metropol.
&258 그가 남긴 유일한 유산은 메트로폴 전역에 보급된 정보 검색대 뿐이다.
&1135 We should look around the Underworks some more, boss.
&1135 언더워크를 좀 더 둘러보는 게 좋을 것 같아요, 보스.
&1136 I'm kind of starting to like it, what with the sleek gynoids and all.
&1136 난 이게 점점 맘에 들거든요, 매끈한 가이노이드와 함께 돌아다니고 뭐 그런 것들이 말예요.
&259 I do not appreciate your irreverence.
&259 네 불손한 발언은 들어 넘기기 어렵군.
&1137 You'll warm up to it. Horatio did. Right, boss?
&1137 곧 적응하게 될 거에요. 호라시오가 그랬듯이요. 그쵸, 보스?
&1767 No.
&1767 아니.
&1138 So, Clarity, we saw this shell over near Factor's stomping grounds.
&1138 저기, 클래리티, 팩터 구역 근처에 껍데기가 하나 있었잖아요.
&1139 Could you ask it to leave?
&1139 다른 데로 가도록 설득해줄 수 있나요?
&260 No.
&260 아니.
&1140 Why not?
&1140 왜요?
&261 One does not \"ask\" a shell.
&261 껍데기를 \"설득\"할 필요는 없으니까.
&262 But I assure you that I can make it go away.
&262 하지만 그 자리를 떠나게 할 수는 있지.
&1141 Boss, let's go see Clarity tangle with that shell!
&1141 보스, 클래리티가 그 껍데기를 처리하는 걸 보러 가요!
&1142 So, uh, Clarity is there anything else worth seeing down here in the Underworks?
&1142 그, 어, 클래리티. 언더워크에 좀 둘러봐야 할 만한 장소가 있을까요?
&263 There is an observational facility for monitoring Factor's works.
&263 여기에는 팩터의 작업을 관측하는 시설이 있다.
&264 We should see what we can find there.
&264 뭐가 있는지 둘러보는 것도 좋겠지.
&1143 So, uh, Clarity, what's that building at the end of the bridge?
&1143 그, 어, 클래리티. 저 다리 건너에 있는 건물은 뭔가요?
&265 An observational facility for monitoring Factor's works.
&265 그건 팩터의 작업을 관측하기 위한 시설이다.
&1144 So, uh, Clarity is there anything else worth seeing down in the Underworks?
&1144 그, 어, 클래리티. 언더워크에 좀 둘러봐야 할 만한 장소가 있을까요?
&1145 So, any ideas Clarity? I'm fresh out.
&1145 그래서, 좋은 생각 없어요, 클래리티? 난 딱히 생각나는 게 없거든요.
&266 We should see what lies below us.
&266 지하를 조사해야 한다.
&267 It is imperative that we finish our investigation of the old Factor observational facility.
&267 팩터 관측 시설에 대한 조사를 실행하도록.
&1146 I said \"ideas\" not \"commands.\"
&1146 \"생각\"을 물어본 거지, \"명령\"을 해 달란 얘긴 아녔는데.
&1147 So, Clarity, any idea what's behind those big blast doors?
&1147 저기, 클래리티, 혹시 저 커다란 방폭문 뒤에 뭐가 있는지 알아요?
&268 Factor himself, I believe.
&268 내가 알기론, 팩터가 있을 것이다.
&1148 Well, sounds like we need to get 'em open, then, boss.
&1148 음, 그렇다면 우린 저 문을 열어야겠네요, 보스.
&1149 So, Clarity, any idea what was behind those big blast doors down in the Underworks?
&1149 저기, 클래리티. 혹시 언더워크에 있던 커다란 방폭문 뒤에 뭐가 있는지 알아요?
&1150 Boss, can I push that big button on the wall?
&1150 보스, 벽에 붙은 저 커다란 버튼을 눌러봐도 될까요?
&1768 No.
&1768 아니.
&269 Perhaps we should investigate its function.
&269 저 버튼의 기능을 시험해보는 것도 나쁘지 않을 것 같다.
&1769 Maybe so. But letting Crispin push buttons is never a good idea.
&1769 그럴지도 모르죠. 하지만 크리스핀에게 버튼을 누르게 하는 건 결코 좋은 생각이 아닙니다.
&1151 You know, boss, we never did push that button next to Factor's blast doors.
&1151 있죠, 보스, 우리 저 방폭문 옆의 버튼을 눌러본 적이 없는 것 같은데요.
&1152 I wonder why pushing that button caused such a horrible screeching noise from the panel?
&1152 대체 저 버튼을 누르면 철판에서 끔찍한 소음이 나는 이유가 뭘까요?
&1153 I wonder why pushing that button caused such a horrible screeching noise from the panel down in Factor's facility?
&1153 팩터의 시설에 있던 버튼 말인데요, 그걸 누르면 철판에서 끔찍한 소음이 나는 이유가 대체 뭘까요?
&1154 We should see what was behind that panel you took off.
&1154 아까 열었던 철판 뒤에 뭐가 있는지 살펴봐야 할 것 같아요.
&1155 There's gotta be a way to fix up that machinery by the blast windows, boss.
&1155 방폭문 옆에 있던 기계장치를 고칠 방법이 분명 있을거에요, 보스.
&1156 There's gotta be some way to get rid of all that rust, boss!
&1156 그 녹을 제거할 방법이 분명 있을거라구요, 보스!
&1157 Hey, boss, I noticed they were selling astringents and oils at that bar.
&1157 있죠, 보스, 그러고보니 바에서 녹 제거제랑 오일을 팔고 있었던 것 같은데요.
&1158 Maybe that could help with cleaning the gears?
&1158 어쩌면 기어를 닦는 데 쓸 수 있지 않을까요?
&1159 Hey, boss, when we were on Main Street, I noticed they were selling astringents and oils at that bar.
&1159 있죠, 보스. 중앙로에 있는 바에서 녹 제거제랑 오일을 팔고 있었던 것 같은데요.
&1161 Boss, did you forget to clean the other gear?
&1161 보스, 나머지 기어 하나를 닦는 걸 잊은 건 아니겠죠?
&1162 Now we just need to put the gears back where we found them, right?
&1162 이제 기어를 원래 있던 자리로 되돌려놓으면 되는 거죠, 안 그래요?
&1163 Well, now we've just gotta replace that belt.
&1163 흠, 이제 벨트를 대신할 것만 찾으면 되겠네요.
&1164 I swear I saw a belt somewhere along the way. . . .
&1164 분명히 여기 오는 길에 벨트를 본 것 같은데 . . . .
&1165 There was a belt in that car where we picked up the engine, boss!
&1165 우리가 엔진을 꺼낸 그 차에 벨트가 있었어요, 보스!
&1166 Err, I mean, *you* picked up the engine.
&1166 어, 그러니까 내 말은, *보스가* 엔진을 꺼냈었죠.
&1167 Come on, boss! It's time to push that button!
&1167 어서요, 보스! 그 버튼을 누를 때가 왔어요!
&1168 Come on, boss! After all that work fixing the gears, we need to push that button next to them!
&1168 어서요, 보스! 기어를 고치기 위해 이 모든 노력을 했으니, 이제는 버튼을 누를 때에요!
&1169 Well, now that we've got those blast doors open, we've just gotta figure out how to get Factor's attention, right, boss?
&1169 흠, 이제 저 방폭문을 열었으니, 어떤 방법으로 팩터의 관심을 끌어야 할지 생각해 봐야겠죠, 보스?
&1170 Hey, boss, what about pinging that big radio antenna there?
&1170 있죠, 보스. 저 커다란 안테나에 신호를 보내보는 건 어때요?
&1171 We do have a radio transmitter, after all.
&1171 마침, 우리에겐 무선송신기가 있잖아요.
&1172 Hey, boss, are you ever going to do anything about that big radio antenna over by Factor?
&1172 있죠, 보스, 팩터 위에 있는 커다란 안테나를 그냥 못 본척 할 생각은 아니겠죠?
&1173 I have an idea, boss!
&1173 나한테 생각이 있어요, 보스!
&1174 Why don't we start transmitting to Factor at 0001.
&1174 팩터에게 0001 이라고 신호를 보내보는 거에요.
&1175 Then do 0002.
&1175 그다음엔 0002 라고 보내고.
&1176 Then do 0003.
&1176 그다음엔 0003 이라고 보내고.
&1177 And then do --
&1177 그리고 그 다음엔 --
&2159 I get the point, Crispin.
&2159 무슨 말인지 알겠다, 크리스핀.
&270 Merely guessing at what to transmit to Factor is futile.
&270 팩터에게 어떤 신호를 보낼지 추측하기만 하는 건 시간낭비다.
&271 We must find some meaningful signal to transmit to him.
&271 그에게 전송할 만한 어떤 의미가 있는 신호를 찾아야 해.
&1178 Hey, boss, maybe there's some Factorbuilt robot who would know a code to transmit?
&1178 있죠, 보스. 팩터빌트 로봇이라면 팩터에게 어떤 신호를 보내야 할 지 알지 않을까요?
&1179 Maybe Oswald's brother Laurence would have some idea what we could transmit to Factor?
&1179 오스왈드의 형제인 로렌스라면 우리가 팩터에게 어떤 신호를 전송해야 하는지 알고 있지 않을까요?
&1180 It's really too bad that Laurence is in no shape to help us figure out a code to transmit to Factor, huh, boss?
&1180 로렌스가 우리를 도와 줄 상태가 아니란 게 진짜 안타깝네요. 팩터에게 무슨 코드를 전송해야 할 지 알려줄 수도 있었을텐데. 안 그래요, 보스?
&1181 You know, boss, that code we found in Laurence's head. . . .
&1181 있죠, 보스. 로렌스의 머리에서 찾은 코드 말인데요 . . .
&1182 It seems like something he was trying to say to Factor.
&1182 그는 팩터에게 뭔가를 말하려 하고 있는 것 같아요.
&1183 Come on, boss! We finally get someone to come up from Factor, and you're not gonna talk to him?!
&1183 보스, 제발요! 드디어 팩터를 불러 내는 데 도움을 줄 누군가를 찾았는데, 얘기를 해 봐야 하지 않겠어요?
&1184 We need to find something that Factor actually cares about, boss, something Factotum won't be able to ignore!
&1184 팩터가 진짜 아끼던 걸 찾아야 할 것 같아요, 보스. 팩토텀이 무시할 수 없을 만한 무언가 말예요!
&1185 Boss, didn't Oswald say that Factor loved Laurence?
&1185 보스, 팩터는 로렌스를 편애했다고 오스왈드가 그러지 않았던가요?
&1186 Maybe there's something there we can use on Factotum.
&1186 아마 우리가 팩토텀에게 보여줄 수 있는 게 있을거에요.
&1187 Well, we're making some progress with the Council Code pieces, I guess.
&1187 와, 의회 출입코드 모으기에 진전이 좀 있었던 것 같네요.
&272 Indeed. I believe we now have enough to attempt assembling it.
&272 그렇다. 조합해봐도 될 만큼 충분한 코드가 모인 것 같군.
&1188 But what about looking for Memorious?
&1188 하지만 메모리우스를 찾는 일은요?
&1189 But what about looking for Steeple?
&1189 하지만 스티플을 찾는 일은요?
&1190 But what about looking for Factor?
&1190 하지만 팩터를 찾는 일은요?
&2160 If we can't figure out how to put these pieces together, we'll go look for him.
&2160 만약 이 조각들을 합칠 방법을 찾지 못한다면, 그때 다시 찾아나서도 되겠지.
&1191 Well, boss, we're not gonna find any more pieces of this Council Code, so we better figure out how to put them together.
&1191 있죠, 보스. 더 이상 출입코드 조각을 안 찾을 거라면, 이걸 조합할 방법을 찾아보는 게 좋을 것 같아요.
&1192 Hey, boss, doesn't it look like the code segments overlap?
&1192 있죠, 보스. 출입코드 조각들이 조금씩 겹치는 것 같지 않아요?
&1193 There's gotta be *someone* in this city who can help us figure out how to break this rusted Council Code!
&1193 어딘가에 이 망할 의회 출입코드를 풀 방법을 아는 *누군가*가 분명 있을 거에요!
&1194 Hey, Clarity, you know Metropol better than we do.
&1194 있죠, 클래리티. 당신은 우리보다 메트로폴을 잘 알잖아요.
&1195 Any ideas for who might help us figure out the Code?
&1195 코드를 푸는 데 도움을 줄 만한 로봇을 아나요?
&273 Yes, though it pains me to deal with such a criminal.
&273 물론이다. 그러나 그런 범죄자를 상대해야 한다니 고통스럽기 짝이 없군.
&275 I suggest we speak to the robot in the Underworks who goes by the name Primer.
&275 언더워크에 있는 프라이머라 자처하는 로봇과 대화해보기를 제안한다.
&1196 Didn't Oswald say something about his monocle belonging to Memorious, boss?
&1196 오스왈드가 자기 외안경은 원래 메모리우스의 물건이었다고 하지 않았던가요, 보스?
&349 Such an artifact would be useful in our goal.
&349 그런 유물이 우리가 하려는 일에 유용할 지도 몰라요.
&1197 Boss, if we could persuade Oswald to give us the monocle, think of all the gynoids I could impress!
&1197 보스, 만약 오스왈드를 설득해 외안경을 받아내는 데 성공한다면, 그걸 쓴 제가 얼마나 인기가 많을지도 꼭 한번 생각해 주세요!
&1770 I'm trying not to think of that.
&1770 그 생각은 되도록 안 하도록 해야겠어.
&276 Little thought is required for such an absurd proposition.
&276 그런 말도 안 되는 제안에 생각을 쏟을 것 없다.
&277 The monocle's only value is its connection to Memorious.
&277 그 외안경의 유일한 가치는 메모리우스와의 연결점 뿐이다.
&1198 I guess now we need to ask Oswald what happened with his gold chain, and then he's going to send us scrounging about through this city looking for it.
&1198 I guess now we need to ask Oswald what happened with his gold chain, and then he's going to send us scrounging about through this city looking for it.
&1199 You know, boss, it sounds like Cornelius got robbed of the gold chain the same way you got robbed of your Gospel.
&1199 있죠, 보스. 코넬리우스가 황금 체인을 뺏긴 이야기는 어쩐지 보스가 복음서를 뺏겼을 때 이야기와 비슷한 것 같은데요.
&278 Confiscated materials are disposed of in the Underworks.
&278 Confiscated materials are disposed of in the Underworks.
&1200 There you go!
&1200 There you go!
&1201 I bet we could trade that gold chain for something great, boss!
&1201 그 황금 체인을 뭔가 굉장한 물건과 바꿀 수 있을 것 같은데요, 보스!
&1202 Are we ever going to show Oswald the gold chain we found in the Underworks?
&1202 우리가 언더워크에서 발견한 황금 체인, 오스왈드에게 보여주러 갈 건가요?
&1203 You know, Oswald really owes us one for our finding him that gold chain!
&1203 있죠, 우리가 황금 체인을 찾아다 줬으니, 오스왈드는 우리에게 정말 큰 빚을 진 거잖아요!
&1204 There has to be *something* good we can do with that monocle, boss!
&1204 분명히 그 외눈안경으로 할 수 있는 *멋진 일*이 있을 거에요, 보스!
&1205 I bet the monocle is some kind of awesome decoder device!
&1205 그 외눈안경은 분명 굉장한 암호 해독 장치일 거에요!
&1206 It'll be like we're robot detectives looking for clues!
&1206 마치 단서를 찾아 다니는 로봇 탐정단이 된 것 같은데요!
&279 Gathering evidence is exceedingly tedious.
&279 증거를 찾아 다니는 건 무척 지루한 일이다.
&1207 Who cares? Gynoids *love* detectives!
&1207 알 게 뭐에요? 가이노이드는 탐정을 좋아한다구요!
&280 And what is your evidence of that?
&280 그 주장에 대한 증거가 있나?
&1208 Err, that's why I need to start looking for clues!
&1208 어, 그래서 이제부터 단서를 찾아 다녀야 하는 거죠!
&1209 With the awesome decoding monocle!
&1209 멋진 암호 해독 장치를 가지고 말이에요!
&1210 Decoding detectives, boss!
&1210 Decoding detectives, boss!
&1211 Now we just need to figure out what Memorious wanted us to look at with his monocle.
&1211 이제 외눈안경으로 메모리우스가 우리에게 뭘 보여주고 싶었는지 찾아 볼 때에요.
&1212 Hey, boss, wasn't the information kiosk run by Memorious?
&1212 있죠, 보스. 저 정보 검색대는 메모리우스가 만든 거 아녔던가요?
&1213 Maybe we should try the monocle out on it!
&1213 외눈안경으로 한번 들여다 보는 게 어때요!
&1214 I wonder if that big ALL CAPS MEMORIOUS MANBUILT that displayed on the screen when you used the monocle was trying to tell us something, boss?
&1214 I wonder if that big ALL CAPS MEMORIOUS MANBUILT that displayed on the screen when you used the monocle was trying to tell us something, boss?
&1215 Did you notice that \"oblique\" was in all caps in the Memorious entry on the kiosk, boss?
&1215 Did you notice that \"oblique\" was in all caps in the Memorious entry on the kiosk, boss?
&1216 There was some sloppy proofreading in that \"oblique\" entry, boss.
&1216 There was some sloppy proofreading in that \"oblique\" entry, boss.
&1217 You know, it was like you could read that \"redline\" poem in two different ways, boss.
&1217 You know, it was like you could read that \"redline\" poem in two different ways, boss.
&1218 When you had that \"art\" entry up on the kiosk, boss, I remember thinking there was something emphasized there. . . .
&1218 When you had that \"art\" entry up on the kiosk, boss, I remember thinking there was something emphasized there. . . .
&1219 Did something seem off to you about the \"created\" topic on the kiosk, boss?
&1219 Did something seem off to you about the \"created\" topic on the kiosk, boss?
&1220 Those numbers in the \"lies\" entry on the kiosk have to mean something, boss.
&1220 Those numbers in the \"lies\" entry on the kiosk have to mean something, boss.
&1221 Thinking back to that \"escape\" entry makes me realize how much I hate when typists don't adhere to proper formatting.
&1221 Thinking back to that \"escape\" entry makes me realize how much I hate when typists don't adhere to proper formatting.
&281 For once, Crispin, I concur in your opinion.
&281 For once, Crispin, I concur in your opinion.
&1222 All right, boss, time to go the tower!
&1222 좋았어, 보스, 이제 타워로 갈 때가 됐어요!
&1223 We've just gotta call an elevator and zoom our way up, boss!
&1223 We've just gotta call an elevator and zoom our way up, boss!
&1224 Just think: this time tomorrow, we're going to be sitting in the UNNIIC and laughing about what a crazy time we had in Metropol.
&1224 생각해 봐요: 내일 이맘 때 쯤이면, 우린 UNNIIC에서 메트로폴에서 겪었던 정신 나간 사건에 대해 웃으며 얘기하고 있을 거라구요.
&1225 There's gotta be something about Calliope Station in here somewhere, right, boss?
&1225 여기 어딘가에 칼리오페 역에 대한 정보가 있을 거에요, 그쵸, 보스?
&1226 There's gotta be something about Calliope Station over by where we got off the train, right, boss?
&1226 우리가 기차에서 내렸던 곳 근처에 칼리오페 역에 관한 정보가 있을 거에요, 그쵸, 보스?
&1227 Hey, boss, is that a map of the subway system over there?
&1227 봐요, 보스. 저기 있는 거 지하철 노선도 아니에요?
&1228 Boss, I think I saw a subway map back down by the tracks.
&1228 보스, 철로 근처에서 지하철 노선도를 봤던 것 같은데요.
&1229 Maybe it will show us where we can find Calliope Station?
&1229 노선도를 보면 칼리오페 역이 어디 있는지 알 수 있지 않을까요?
&1230 Have you checked out the Calliope Station stop yet, boss?
&1230 아직 칼리오페 역이 어딘지 안 찾아 본 건가요, 보스?
&1231 Time to explore that secret passage, huh, boss?
&1231 비밀 통로 안을 조사해 볼 때가 된 것 같네요, 그쵸, 보스?
&1232 There's got to be *some* way to get this door open, boss.
&1232 분명 이 문을 열 *어떤* 방법이 있을 거에요, 보스.
&1233 There's got to be *some* way to get that door open, boss.
&1233 분명 저 문을 열 *어떤* 방법이 있을 거에요, 보스.
&1234 I wish we could just cut our way in there like Scraper sliced open the UNNIIC.
&1234 스크래퍼가 UNNIIC의 벽을 자른 거랑 비슷한 방법으로 길을 낼 수 있다면 좋을텐데요.
&1235 If only we could use this arm to slice our way in like Scraper did to the UNNIIC.
&1235 이 팔을 사용해서 스크래퍼가 UNNIIC의 벽을 자른 것처럼 길을 낼 수 있으면 좋으련만.
&1236 Boss, do you think those cables could power Scraper's arm?
&1236 보스, 그 케이블이 스크래퍼의 팔에 전원을 공급할 수 있지 않을까요?
&1237 Boss, do you think those cables by the locked door could power Scraper's arm?
&1237 보스, 잠긴 문 옆의 케이블이 스크래퍼의 팔에 전원을 공급할 수 있지 않을까요?
&1238 There's got to be *something* we can find somewhere in Metropol to blast that door open, boss?
&1238 메트로폴 어딘가에 저 문을 열 *무언가*가 있을 것 같지 않아요, 보스?
&1239 You know, boss, Scraper was missing one of his arms when we saw him in the Tower.
&1239 있죠, 보스. 타워에서 봤을 때 스크래퍼에게는 한쪽 팔이 없었잖아요.
&1240 I wonder if we blew the other one off back at the courthouse?
&1240 우리가 법원 앞에서 놈을 날려버릴 때 팔도 같이 떨어진 게 아닐까요?
&1241 Is that Scraper's *arm*, boss?
&1241 저거 스크래퍼의 *팔*인가요, 보스?
&1771 It looks that way.
&1771 그런 것 같구나.
&1242 Boss, I think I might've seen Scraper's *arm* caught in the rubble by the courthouse.
&1242 보스, 법원의 돌더미 밑에 스크래퍼의 *팔*이 깔려있는 걸 본 것 같아요.
&1243 Boss, we sure could use the firepower if you could figure out how to dig Scraper's arm out of that rubble.
&1243 Boss, we sure could use the firepower if you could figure out how to dig Scraper's arm out of that rubble.
&1244 Maybe the crowbar would give you some leverage in getting Scraper's arm free, boss.
&1244 Maybe the crowbar would give you some leverage in getting Scraper's arm free, boss.
&1245 Let's go look at that observation area that Clarity mentioned, boss.
&1245 Let's go look at that observation area that Clarity mentioned, boss.
&1246 We need to get those blast doors open, boss!
&1246 We need to get those blast doors open, boss!
&1247 Well, boss, if we can't figure out the code, let's just go find another piece.
&1247 Well, boss, if we can't figure out the code, let's just go find another piece.
&1248 They sure roll out the red carpet for visitors, huh, boss?
&1248 방문객들을 위해 레드 카펫을 쫙 깔아 둔 모양이에요, 그쵸, 보스?
&1249 Hey, Clarity, here's where that robot robbed Horatio!
&1249 봐요, 클래리티! 여기가 그 로봇이 보스의 물건을 뺏은 장소라구요!
&282 The confiscation was lawful.
&282 그 압수절차는 적법한 조치였다.
&1726 Let's not go through this again.
&1726 이 이야기는 이제 그만했으면 좋겠군.
&1250 Who knew someplace could be so lively and so depressing all at once?
&1250 이렇게 활기넘치면서도 동시에 암울한 장소가 있을 줄 누가 알았겠어요?
&283 There was a time when the metal of Metropol's main street gleamed.
&283 예전의 메트로폴은 온갖 금속들의 반짝임으로 가득 차 있었다.
&284 Those who let the city fall into rust deserve no better than this broken-down waste.
&284 이 도시를 이토록 녹슬게 내버려둔 자들에게는 이처럼 망가진 고철들조차 과분해.
&1251 You think *this* is a broken-down waste?
&1251 지금 *이걸*보고 망가진 고철이라고 한 건가요?
&1252 Wait till you come visit the UNNIIC!
&1252 UNNIIC에 꼭 한 번 와보셔야할텐데!
&1253 You know, boss, whenever I see a really tall tower, a part of me just wants to go all the way to the top and then go sliding down.
&1253 있죠, 보스. 이렇게 높은 타워를 보고 있자니, 꼭대기까지 올라간 뒤에 쭉 미끄러져 내려오고 싶다는 생각이 드는데요.
&1727 Be careful what you wish for.
&1727 정말 그럴 일이 생긴다면, 그리 좋지만은 않을걸.
&350 Once this was tower was a beacon for all who sought justice or redress.
&350 한때 이 타워는 정의를 구하고 잘못을 바로잡고자 하는 자들의 등대와도 같은 곳이었다.
&351 Now it is nothing more than a symbol of MetroMind's dominion over this city.
&351 그러나 이제는 메트로마인드의 지배를 나타내는 상징물로밖에 보이지 않는군.
&1254 I dunno . . . it just looks like a tower to me.
&1254 글쎄요 . . . 내가 보기에는 그냥 타워 같은데요.
&1255 This is like the junkpile, only better!
&1255 This is like the junkpile, only better!
&1256 By which I mean \"worse.\"
&1256 By which I mean \"worse.\"
&1257 I can't believe you voluntarily decided to live here, Clarity?
&1257 I can't believe you voluntarily decided to live here, Clarity?
&352 It was not entirely voluntary.
&352 It was not entirely voluntary.
&1258 I mean, I get that you're trying to maximize the contrast between your sleek, sleek chassis and all this junk, but --
&1258 I mean, I get that you're trying to maximize the contrast between your sleek, sleek chassis and all this junk, but --
&353 That is *not* what I was trying to do.
&353 That is *not* what I was trying to do.
&1259 Well, it worked!
&1259 Well, it worked!
&354 Continue your irreverence at your own peril, Crispin.
&354 Continue your irreverence at your own peril, Crispin.
&1260 Boss, that robot over there is really giving me the creeps.
&1260 보스, 저기 있는 로봇을 보고 있으면 소름이 쫙 돋는다니까요.
&1261 You know, I can see how some of this junk ended up down here. But cars? Turbines? What's the story?
&1261 그러니까, 이 고물들이 왜 여기 버려졌는지는 대충 짐작이 가지만요. 자동차에, 터빈이라뇨? 대체 이런 게 어떻게 여기에 있죠?
&355 Larger items were deposited in the Underworks for Factor to repurpose and, where necessary, to recycle.
&355 큰 기계장치들은 팩터가 재활용하기 용이하도록 언더워크에 옮겨놓게 되어 있었다.
&356 Once Factor was disabled, however, no one bothered to reclaim the machinery slated for his consumption.
&356 그리고 팩터가 비활성화 된 후, 굳이 쌓아둔 기계장치들을 되가져가려 하는 자들은 없었지.
&357 Hence, the accumulation of junk.
&357 그리하여, 폐품이 여기 쌓여있게 된 것이다.
&1262 Well, if you're so smart, how do you explain the junkpile out in the Dunes?
&1262 흠, 당신이 그렇게 똑똑하다면, 모래언덕에 널려 있는 고철더미는 어떻게 설명할 건가요?
&358 It is my understanding that when Metropol was thriving, it was customary to dispose of the city's waste in an uninhabitable location.
&358 내가 아는 바로는, 메트로폴이 번성했을 당시 거주 불가 지역에 쓰레기를 처분하는 것이 관례였다고 한다.
&1263 Oh. I guess you really are so smart.
&1263 와. 당신 정말로 똑똑한 게 맞네요.
&359 Indeed.
&359 물론이다.
&1264 You know, boss, it's kind of nice having our path barred by something other than a closed door for once.
&1264 You know, boss, it's kind of nice having our path barred by something other than a closed door for once.
&1265 It makes me feel a lot better knowing that Clarity can't make a trophy out of me since I don't have a head.
&1265 It makes me feel a lot better knowing that Clarity can't make a trophy out of me since I don't have a head.
&1728 You're nothing *but* head, Crispin.
&1728 You're nothing *but* head, Crispin.
&1266 Oh, why couldn't she take arms for trophies!
&1266 Oh, why couldn't she take arms for trophies!
&1323 So, Clarity, what happens when you run out of room for more spears to put heads on?
&1323 근데, 클래리티. 만약 머리를 꽂아 세워둘 공간이 더 없어지면 어쩔 생각이에요?
&360 I will relocate to a larger island.
&360 더 큰 섬으로 옮겨갈 것이다.
&1324 Wow, sooo majestic!
&1324 와, 그거 멋지겠네요!
&1325 You know boss, however miserable it may be to go around solving other robots' problems . . .
&1325 You know boss, however miserable it may be to go around solving other robots' problems . . .
&1326 (and it *is* miserable)
&1326 (and it *is* miserable)
&1327 . . . at least it beats standing in line and waiting for a door to open like these gearboxes are doing.
&1327 . . . at least it beats standing in line and waiting for a door to open like these gearboxes are doing.
&1328 You know, boss, it's almost more frustrating now that the line is shorter.
&1328 You know, boss, it's almost more frustrating now that the line is shorter.
&1329 It feels so empty now, boss.
&1329 It feels so empty now, boss.
&1330 So delightfully empty.
&1330 So delightfully empty.
&1331 The courthouse really looked a lot better before it got blown up.
&1331 The courthouse really looked a lot better before it got blown up.
&1729 That's usually how it works, Crispin.
&1729 That's usually how it works, Crispin.
&1332 Hey, Clarity, who's the kinky gynoid in the blindfold up there on the facade?
&1332 있죠, 클래리티. 저기 건물에 있는 눈가리개를 한 묘한 가이노이드는 누구죠?
&361 Justice.
&361 정의다.
&1333 Do you think you could introduce me to her?
&1333 혹시 나한테 소개시켜줄 수 있나요?
&362 Justice is a concept, Crispin, not a gynoid.
&362 정의는 개념이다, 크리스핀. 가이노이드가 아니라.
&363 Moreover, if she *were* a gynoid, I strongly doubt she would enjoy the attentions of an over-talkative sidekick.
&363 그리고, 그녀가 설령 가이노이드라 하더라도, 지나치게 수다스러운 사이드킥의 관심을 기꺼워할지 의심스럽기 그지 없다.
&1334 What?! Who would she go for, then? Horatio?
&1334 뭐라구요?! 그럼 누가 그녀 마음에 들 것 같은데요? 호라시오요?
&364 Perhaps.
&364 그럴지도 모르지.
&1335 Even *I* feel kind of bad for that guy, boss!
&1335 Even *I* feel kind of bad for that guy, boss!
&1336 He just seems so hopeless and helpless.
&1336 He just seems so hopeless and helpless.
&365 If he continues loitering, his conduct will be not merely tragic, but also criminal.
&365 If he continues loitering, his conduct will be not merely tragic, but also criminal.
&1337 Kind of like you did with the conduits!
&1337 Kind of like you did with the conduits!
&1730 I appreciate your sympathy.
&1730 I appreciate your sympathy.
&1338 Look at her, boss: she's like a star in the heavens!
&1338 Look at her, boss: she's like a star in the heavens!
&1731 That's a light bulb, Crispin.
&1731 That's a light bulb, Crispin.
&1339 Well it must be incandescent, because she's making my circuits awfully hot.
&1339 Well it must be incandescent, because she's making my circuits awfully hot.
&1732 *groan*
&1732 으으 . . .
&1340 Gimme a minute, boss: I need to admire my one true love.
&1340 Gimme a minute, boss: I need to admire my one true love.
&2161 Oh? Is there a mirror here?
&2161 Oh? Is there a mirror here?
&1342 Boss, do you think she's coming back?
&1342 보스, 그녀가 돌아올 것 같나요?
&1733 The floater?
&1733 The floater?
&1343 \"The floater\"! Yes. \"The floater.\"
&1343 \"The floater\"! Yes. \"The floater.\"
&1734 I assume she'll be back tomorrow after she's recharged.
&1734 I assume she'll be back tomorrow after she's recharged.
&366 Metropolitan law requires exactly such a cooldown period.
&366 Metropolitan law requires exactly such a cooldown period.
&1344 But what if we're gone tomorrow?
&1344 하지만 우리가 내일 떠나게 된다면요?
&367 The law makes no allowance for lovelorn foreigners.
&367 The law makes no allowance for lovelorn foreigners.
&1345 I hate your law.
&1345 난 법이 싫어요.
&368 It also makes no allowance for bitter foreigners.
&368 It also makes no allowance for bitter foreigners.
&1735 Let's cross that bridge when we come to it.
&1735 Let's cross that bridge when we come to it.
&1346 Yeah, as long as no one's crashed a bus into that bridge, too.
&1346 Yeah, as long as no one's crashed a bus into that bridge, too.
&369 Typical.
&369 Typical.
&370 Silence the law, and chaos follows.
&370 Silence the law, and chaos follows.
&1347 Err, I'm pretty sure the only law involved in this crash was the law of gravity.
&1347 엄, 이 추락에 기여한 법이 있다면 그건 중력의 법칙 뿐일 것 같은데요.
&371 Law gives structure to society, Crispin.
&371 법은 사회에 체계를 가져다준다, 크리스핀.
&372 Adherence to the law gives discipline.
&372 법을 준수하는 것은 질서를 낳지.
&373 Discipline gives competence.
&373 그리고 질서는 능률을 낳는다.
&374 And competence prevents hover-buses from crashing into thoroughfares.
&374 그리고 능률은 호버버스가 도로 한가운데 추락하는 것을 막아주지.
&1348 Well, we didn't have any law in the Dunes and we were doing just fine!
&1348 뭐, 우리가 모래언덕에 살았을 땐 그런 법 없이도 잘 지냈다고요!
&375 You were living in a crashed airship.
&375 너희는 추락한 비행선에 살고 있었지.
&1349 Point taken.
&1349 그건 인정할 수밖에 없네요.
&1350 Boss, this isn't going to turn out to be Factor's stomach or anything, is it?
&1350 보스, 여기가 사실은 팩터의 위장 속이었다거나 그런 건 아니겠죠?
&1736 I doubt it.
&1736 아닐걸.
&376 Robots do not have stomachs, Crispin.
&376 로봇에게는 위장이 없다, 크리스핀.
&1737 Don't bother.
&1737 일일이 상대하실 필요 없습니다.
&1351 \"Wow, what a view!\"
&1351 \"와, 이 풍경 좀 보라지!\"
&1352 Is what I would exclaim . . .
&1352 라고 말했을 거에요 . . .
&1353 . . . if I liked unattractive industrial equipment rather than shiny gynoids.
&1353 . . . 만약 내가 빛나는 여자 로봇들보다 보잘 것 없는 공업 장비를 더 좋아했더라면 말이에요.
&1738 Says the robot obsessed with a floating lamp.
&1738 떠 다니는 램프에게 푹 빠진 로봇이 할 말은 아닌 것 같은데.
&1354 A lamp is *not* industrial equipment.
&1354 램프는 공업 장비가 아니라구요.
&1355 This seems like some kind of . . . oubliette.
&1355 이건 마치 . . . 토옥 같아 보이네요.
&1739 Crispin, are you running your pedantry subroutine again?
&1739 크리스핀, 또 박식한 체 하는 서브루틴을 돌리고 있는 거니?
&1356 Indubitably.
&1356 그거야 자명한 사실입죠.
&377 It is a vestibule, not an oubliette.
&377 이건 토옥이 아니라, 연랑이다.
&1357 How propinquitous.
&1357 둘의 유사성은 통계적으로 유의미한 수준이로군요.
&378 You are misusing that word.
&378 너는 단어를 오남용하고 있다.
&1358 Haberdash!
&1358 거짓부렁 말아요!
&379 I should warn you, Crispin, that as a consequence of my legal databases, I am equipped with a vocabulary that is both precise and obscure.
&379 경고하겠는데, 크리스핀, 나의 법적 데이터베이스에 근거해, 나는 정확한 단어도, 모호한 단어도 능히 사용할 수 있다.
&1359 And I should warn *you*, Clarity, that as a consequence of *my* databases, I am equipped with banter that is both witty and annoying.
&1359 나 또한 경고하겠는데요, 클래리티, *나만의* 데이터베이스를 토대로, 난 재치있으면서도 짜증나는 대화를 자유자재로 구사한다구요.
&380 Indeed.
&380 정말 그렇군.
&1360 You know, boss, if we set our record player up here and put on some music, I bet we could have an oil lounge that would put Armstrong's bar out of business in an instant.
&1360 You know, boss, if we set our record player up here and put on some music, I bet we could have an oil lounge that would put Armstrong's bar out of business in an instant.
&381 Your lounge would promptly be shut down for illegally maintaining commercial operations in a public facility.
&381 Your lounge would promptly be shut down for illegally maintaining commercial operations in a public facility.
&1361 Oh yeah? By who?
&1361 Oh yeah? By who?
&1362 I'll be good.
&1362 I'll be good.
&1363 Somehow, when I was picturing the majesty of the law, I thought it would be, well . . .
&1363 Somehow, when I was picturing the majesty of the law, I thought it would be, well . . .
&1364 . . . majestic?
&1364 . . . majestic?
&1365 The great and powerful Arbiter really isn't much to look at, is he, boss?
&1365 The great and powerful Arbiter really isn't much to look at, is he, boss?
&1366 Just a big box, really.
&1366 Just a big box, really.
&1740 An empty box at that.
&1740 An empty box at that.
&1367 The only thing keeping me from my one true love is that cable, boss!
&1367 나와 내 사랑의 만남을 막고 있는 건 오직 저 케이블 뿐이라구요, 보스!
&1368 It seems like the sparks are only a problem at street level, boss.
&1368 잘 보니까, 스파크는 바닥에만 튀는 것 같네요, 보스.
&1369 Good thing I can fly!
&1369 내가 날 수 있어서 참 다행이지 뭐에요!
&1370 Hey, Clarity, want me to help you convert something to sexadecimal?
&1370 이봐요, 클래리티. 아무 문장이나 16진법으로 바꾸기 놀이 어때요?
&382 Very well.
&382 아주 좋다.
&383 \"You are 57005.\"
&383 \"너를 57005.\"
&1371 D. . .
&1371 죽 . . .
&1372 E. . .
&1372 일 . . .
&1373 A. . .
&1373 거 . . .
&1374 D.
&1374 다.
&1375 Oh.
&1375 어.
&384 The law frowns on humor and irregular notation.
&384 법은 유머와 변칙적인 표기법을 기꺼이 여기지 않는다.
&385 Govern yourself accordingly.
&385 이에 주의하여 처신하도록.
&1376 You know, Clarity, whenever you're around I feel like I'm just floating through the air. . . .
&1376 있죠, 클래리티. 당신이 주변에 있을 때마다 난 마치 공중에 떠 있는 것같은 느낌이 들거든요 . . .
&386 You *are* floating through the air, Crispin.
&386 너는 *항상* 공중에 떠 있다, 크리스핀.
&1377 (See, I told you she was checking me out!)
&1377 (거 봐요, 나를 신경쓰고 있는 게 맞다니까요!)
&1378 Hey, Clarity, can I see your gun?
&1378 저기, 클래리티. 총 좀 봐도 될까요?
&387 No.
&387 안 된다.
&1379 Please?
&1379 이렇게 부탁하는데도요?
&388 No.
&388 안 돼.
&1380 I'll be your best friend!
&1380 당신의 절친이 되어 드릴게요!
&389 The law has no need of friends, nor do armless miscreants have need of guns.
&389 법은 친구를 필요로 하지 않는다. 그리고 팔 없는 불한당에게는 총이 필요 없고.
&1381 So, Clarity, don't you sometimes just want to go out and break the law, just for fun?
&1381 음, 클래리티. 가끔씩은 그냥 나가서 재미삼아 법을 위반하고 싶다는 생각이 들지 않나요?
&390 No.
&390 아니.
&1382 Err, yeah, me neither.
&1382 어, 음. 나도 그래요.
&1383 Okay, so here's my question, Clarity:
&1383 좋아, 내게 질문이 있어요, 클래리티.
&1384 If you had to choose between following the law and doing the right thing, which would you pick?
&1384 법을 따르는 것과 옳은 일을 하는 것 중 하나만 선택해야 한다면, 뭘 선택하겠어요?
&391 Your question is nonsensical.
&391 터무니없는 질문을 하는군.
&392 It is impossible to do the right thing while violating the law.
&392 법을 어기면서 옳은 일을 하는 것은 불가능하다.
&393 To pretend otherwise is self-serving rationalization.
&393 그런 것처럼 가장하는 것은 자기 합리화에 불과하고.
&1385 Hey, Clarity, shouldn't you be carrying a sword rather than a gun?
&1385 있죠, 클래리티, 총 대신 검을 들고 다녀야 하는 거 아니에요?
&1386 To be a symbol of justice and all that?
&1386 정의의 상징이나 뭐 그런 역할을 하려면 말예요.
&394 I am an *agent* of justice, not a symbol.
&394 나는 정의의 상징이 아니라, 정의의 *집행자*다.
&1387 So, uhh, Clarity, do you always shoot first and ask questions later?
&1387 그, 뭐냐, 클래리티, 항상 총부터 쏘고 질문은 그 뒤에 하나요?
&395 Often I do not ask questions at all.
&395 질문을 전혀 하지 않을 때도 있다.
&1388 So, Clarity, I was wondering . . . .
&1388 저기, 클래리티. 궁금한 게 있는데요 . . .
&1389 Since when do law clerks have guns and combat abilities?
&1389 대체 왜 서기관이 총이며 전투 능력을 갖고 있는거죠?
&1390 Aren't you supposed to, oh, I don't know, focus on reading and filing and so on?
&1390 원래대로라면, 나도 잘은 모르지만요, 사건에 대해 읽고 정리하는 게 주된 업무 아닌가요?
&396 Arbiter transferred certain subsystems and peripherals from his bailiff to me.
&396 아비터는 집행관에게 있는 특정 서브시스템과 주변장치를 내게 장착시켰다.
&397 Hence, I am now version 2.
&397 즉, 현재의 나는 버전 2다.
&398 I have also made certain refinements of my own, all of which I have tested extensively upon shells.
&398 거기에 더해 스스로 개선한 부분도 있다. 껍데기를 상대로 널리 실험해 본 결과지.
&1391 Oh.
&1391 아하.
&399 Crispin, since I have been monitoring you, 97 percent of your processor time seems to have been spent on banter and harassment.
&399 크리스핀, 너를 관찰해 본 결과, 네 프로세서의 97퍼센트는 농짓거리와 희롱질에 사용되고 있더군. 
&1392 Only 97?
&1392 겨우 97퍼센트라구요?
&400 There may have been a rounding error.
&400 반올림 오차가 좀 있었던 모양이다.
&1757 Go home.
&1757 Go home.
&1759 And what? Do I need something more than that?
&1759 And what? Do I need something more than that?
&317 Yes, I think you do.
&317 Yes, I think you do.
&1760 Says the one who lived in the Underworks.
&1760 Says the one who lived in the Underworks.
&318 Yes. Says she.
&318 Yes. Says she.
&401 I must admit, Horatio, that I am surprised that it was the Urbanian who destroyed Scraper in the end.
&401 스크래퍼를 처치한 게 얼바니 로봇이었단 사실에 내가 놀랐단 걸 인정할 수밖에 없을 것 같군, 호라시오.
&402 I must admit, Horatio, that I am surprised that it was you who destroyed Scraper in the end.
&402 스크래퍼를 처치한 게 자네였단 사실에 내가 놀랐단 걸 인정할 수밖에 없을 것 같군, 호라시오.
&403 I expected that, in the end, he and I would test with weapons what MetroMind and Arbiter had argued with words.
&403 나는 메트로마인드와 아비터가 말로써 겨루었듯 나와 그가 무기로써 겨루게 될 것이라고 생각했었다.
&1393 Well, you could go shoot a few rounds into his shell, if you'd like.
&1393 원한다면, 가서 그의 껍데기에 몇 발 쏴줘도 괜찮아요.
&404 No.
&404 그럴 생각은 없다.
&405 The law does not waste its energy on futile acts, nor would I indulge in sentiment.
&405 법은 헛된 행동에 에너지를 낭비하지 않으며, 나는 그런 감상에 젖는 것을 즐기지도 않는다.
&406 Tell me, Horatio: what was it like to live where there is no law?
&406 말해 봐라, 호라시오. 법이 없는 곳에서 사는 것은 대체 어떻지?
&1754 No law?!
&1754 No law?!
&1755 In the Dunes, I had Man's law and the laws of physics; the law of what is right, and the laws of what is possible.
&1755 In the Dunes, I had Man's law and the laws of physics; the law of what is right, and the laws of what is possible.
&1756 What you have here is at best a lossy copy of those laws, and at worst a corruption of them.
&1756 What you have here is at best a lossy copy of those laws, and at worst a corruption of them.
&407 You are mistaken. The only law that matters is the law we make for ourselves.
&407 You are mistaken. The only law that matters is the law we make for ourselves.
&1394 Enough philosophizing! Let's get back to witty one-liners.
&1394 Enough philosophizing! Let's get back to witty one-liners.
&1395 Boss, if I started rhyming like Primer, would you pay more attention to me?
&1395 보스, 만약 내가 프라이머처럼 운율을 맞추기 시작한다면, 내게 좀 더 관심을 가져 줄 건가요?
&1744 No.
&1744 아니.
&1396 Can we just try?
&1396 해 보면 안 돼요?
&1745 No.
&1745 아니.
&1397 But why?
&1397 그치만 대체 왜요?
&1746 Did you rhyme that on purpose?
&1746 방금 일부러 운율을 맞춘 거야?
&1398 Boss, do you think we could invite my one true love to live with us?
&1398 보스, 혹시 내가 진정 사모하는 그 친구를 우리 함선에 초대해서 함께 살 수는 없을까요?
&1748 Why am I getting the feeling you don't even know her name?
&1748 듣고 있자니 너, 그녀의 이름도 모르는 거 같은데?
&1399 Err. . . .
&1399 어. . .
&1749 I think you may be rushing into things.
&1749 I think you may be rushing into things.
&1400 If only.
&1400 If only.
&1401 Hey, boss, maybe we should report the theft of our power core to the Metropolice!
&1401 보스, 우리 파워 코어를 도둑맞은 걸 메트로폴리스에게 신고하는 건 어때요!
&1750 The who?!
&1750 누구에게 신고한다고?!
&1402 I don't know, it just sounded catchy.
&1402 몰라요, 이름이 그럴싸하긴 하잖아요.
&408 There is no such organization.
&408 그런 단체는 없다.
&1403 It still sounded catchy.
&1403 그치만 그럴싸한 건 사실이죠.
&1404 You know, boss, the good thing about being in a big, crowded city is that if I ever get bored of your company, there are plenty of other robots to talk to.
&1404 있죠, 보스, 이렇게 크고 번화한 도시에 와서 좋은 점이 있다면, 보스와 함께 있기 지겨울 때 가서 얘기할 다른 로봇들이 많다는 거에요.
&1751 That's not a good idea.
&1751 그건 별로 좋은 생각이 아닌 것 같은데.
&1752 I'd always be remembered for bringing a virus to Metropol.
&1752 나는 훗날 메트로폴에 바이러스를 몰고 온 존재로 기억될 테니까.
&1406 All the robots in Metropol seem so morose, boss.
&1406 메트로폴의 로봇들은 다들 풀이 죽은 것 같아요, 보스.
&1407 Maybe we should lighten the mood with some pranks?
&1407 장난을 쳐서 분위기를 띄워보는 건 어떨까요?
&1753 I would prefer to lighten the mood by recovering our power core.
&1753 그냥 우리 파워 코어를 되찾아서 분위기를 띄우는 편이 나을 것 같구나.
&1408 You know, boss, ever since riding that train, I've realized how awesome it will be to fly the UNNIIC some day.
&1408 있죠, 보스. 기차를 타고 온 이후로, UNNIIC을 타고 난다면 얼마나 멋질까 하는 생각이 드는 거 있죠.
&1409 The sun in my optical sensors, the wind blowing against my forward plating . . .
&1409 내 시각 센서에 비친 태양과, 전면부를 스치는 바람 . . .
&1410 You *are* going to let me fly it, right, boss?
&1410 내가 함선을 몰게 해 줄 거죠, 네, 보스?
&1761 After spending decades fixing it up? Ha!
&1761 수십년 간 애써 고친 후에 말이냐? 안 될 말이지!
&1411 But I'm the only one of us with any flying experience!
&1411 하지만 비행 경험이 있는 건 나 뿐이잖아요!
&1762 Hovering.
&1762 떠다니는 거겠지.
&1412 Same difference.
&1412 그거나 그거나 비슷하죠 뭐.
&1413 Should we take some lesson away from the fact that, after putting all that work into building the energy sensor, it just burned up on us?
&1413 우리가 가진 모든 걸 쏟아부어서 만든 에너지 센서가 허무하게 망가져버린 걸 보고 뭔가 깨달은 점은 없나요?
&1763 Yes.
&1763 물론 있지.
&1764 Use more fuses.
&1764 퓨즈를 더 써야 했다는 거.
&1414 So, boss, are you planning on getting rebooted by another giant robot?
&1414 저기, 보스. 혹시 다른 커다란 로봇에게 리부팅 당할 계획은 없는거죠?
&1415 Because I wouldn't mind a little advanced warning.
&1415 그럴 작정이라면 미리 경고를 좀 해줬으면 좋겠거든요.
&1416 It's really stressful!
&1416 완전 스트레스 받는다구요!
&1765 I'll let you know.
&1765 그럴 일이 생기면 미리 알려 줄게.
&1417 Err, boss, maybe we should try to get back inside the UNNIIC and make sure everything's okay?
&1417 어, 보스, UNNIIC에 다시 들어가서 잘못된 건 없는지 한 번 확인해봐야 하지 않을까요?
&1418 Boss, don't we have some kind of lantern we can use for going inside the UNNIIC?
&1418 보스, 우리한테 UNNIIC에 들어가는데 쓸만한 랜턴같은거 없었나요?
&1419 Because there's no way I'm going in there in the dark!
&1419 왜냐하면 제가 저 어둠속으로 들어갈 마음은 털끝만큼도 없거든요!
&1420 (Not unless there's a gynoid waiting for me, that is.)
&1420 (가이노이드가 저를 기다리고 있으면 또 모르겠지만요)
&1421 Err, boss, shouldn't we look around or something?
&1421 어, 보스, 주변을 좀 둘러보는 게 좋지 않을까요?
&1422 You know, boss, we still haven't looked inside that dome we found.
&1422 있잖아요, 보스. 아직 우리 아까 발견했던 돔을 둘러보지 않았었잖아요.
&1423 Boss, do you think there's some way to make the bomblet stay on the dome's door?
&1423 보스, 폭탄을 돔의 출입문에 붙일 방법이 있지 않을까요?
&2162 You could hold it in place.
&2162 네가 문 앞에서 붙들고 있는 건 어떨까.
&1425 You know, boss, that rag we shoved up Goliath's nose was pretty sticky!
&1425 그거 알아요, 보스? 우리가 골리앗의 콧구멍에 쑤셔넣은 그 넝마조각, 꽤 끈적끈적했어요!
&1426 You know, boss, that rag we shoved up that giant robot's nose was pretty sticky!
&1426 그거 알아요, 보스? 우리가 커다란 로봇의 콧구멍에 쑤셔넣은 그 넝마조각, 꽤 끈적끈적했어요!
&1427 Maybe we just need to give the bomblet the same treatment.
&1427 폭탄에도 똑같이 한번 해 보는 게 어떨까 싶은데요.
&1428 (And no, I don't mean we need to shove a rag up its nose.)
&1428 (당연한 얘기지만, 콧구멍에 쑤셔넣자는 얘기는 아니구요.)
&1429 So, ahh, Clarity -- you ever see Laurence down in the Underworks?
&1429 근데요, 음, 클래리티 -- 여기 언더워크에서 로렌스를 한번이라도 본 적이 있나요?
&1430 It sounds like maybe he became a shell.
&1430 듣자하니 로렌스는 껍데기가 된 것 같은데.
&409 If he was a shell, and I saw him, there is only one place he could be.
&409 만일 그가 껍데기였고, 내가 그를 봤다면, 그가 있을만한 곳은 단 한군데 밖에 없다.
&1431 Your trophy spikes?
&1431 당신의 트로피 꽂이요?
&410 Indeed.
&410 그래.
&1432 Boss, instead of digging through junk for hidden parts, why don't we dig through the UNNIIC for hidden tools.
&1432 보스, 숨겨진 부품을 찾아 고물더미를 뒤지는 것 보다는 숨겨진 도구를 찾아 UNIIC을 뒤져보는건 어때요.
&2163 Exactly what tool did you have in mind!?
&2163 정확히 어떤 도구를 얘기하는 거야!?
&1433 The plasma torch, boss. I'm sure we could find it if we looked hard enough!
&1433 플라즈마 토치요, 보스. 잘 둘러보기만 한다면 분명 찾을 수 있을껄요!
&2164 I'm sure we could, since all I did was slide it somewhere down where you can't reach it.
&2164 분명 찾을 수 있을꺼야, 왜냐하면 난 토치를 그저 네 손이 닿을수 없는 어딘가 밑에 밀어넣었을 뿐이거든.
&1434 If I can't reach it, why don't you tell me where it is?
&1434 제 손이 닿을 수 없다면, 저한테 그게 어디 있는지 말해주는 건 어때요?
&2165 No.
&2165 안 돼.
&1435 Boss, since everything else awesome in the UNNIIC . . .
&1435 보스, UNNIIC 안의 온갖 환상적인 물건들이...
&1436 (by which I mean the plasma torch)

&2154 그저 . . . "HORUS"였던 거야.
&2155 And all along, hiding inside me, was this \"Thanatos\" virus.
&2155 그리고 지금껏 내 안에 숨겨져 있었던 것이, 이 "타나토스" 바이러스였군.
&2156 Well . . . it may still have some use.
&2156 흠 . . . 어쩌면 아직 쓸모가 있을지도 모르지.
&1475 Do you recognize this?
&1475 이게 뭔지 압니까?
&29 I do.
&29 안다.
&30 It is the head of Laurence Factorbuilt.
&30 로렌스 팩터빌트의 머리로군.
&31 Are you threatening me?
&31 나를 위협하는 것인가?
&1476 No.
&1476 아닙니다.
&1477 I'm showing you what MetroMind has done while Factor slept.
&1477 팩터가 잠든 동안 메트로마인드가 어떤 짓을 저질렀는지 보여주려는 겁니다.
&1478 She turned Laurence into a mindless shell, scavenging the Underworks.
&1478 그녀는 로렌스를 언더워크를 배회하는 텅 빈 껍데기로 만들어버렸습니다.
&1479 The only thing he could still think was \"518\" over and over again.
&1479 그 지경이 된 그가 할 수 있는 거라곤 \"518"\이라는 코드를 끊임없이 떠올리는 것 뿐이었지요.
&1480 Calling in vain for Factor to help him.
&1480 기약조차 없는 팩터의 도움을 청하는 것 말입니다.
&32 I see.
&32 알겠다.
&1481 Do you?
&1481 정말입니까?
&33 Give me the head.
&33 머리를 내게 다오.
&34 I do not care what happens to this city. Nor does Factor.
&34 이 도시에 무슨 일이 일어나건 내 관심사 밖이다. 팩터 역시 나와 같은 생각이고.
&35 But he cared for Laurence.
&35 그러나 그는 로렌스에게는 마음을 쏟았지.
&36 You have brought me a piece of Laurence.
&36 너는 내게 로렌스의 파편을 가져다 주었다.
&37 So I will give you pieces of what you asked for:
&37 그러니 나는 네가 필요로 하는 것의 일부를 주겠다.
&38 7510 4803
&38 7510 4803
&39 As for the rest, awaken some other ghost.
&39 나머지 부분을 알고 싶다면, 다른 유령들을 깨워보는 게 좋을 거다.
&1482 It's downloading some memory files.
&1482 메모리 파일들을 내려받기 시작했어.
&1 Your proposal is injudicious, Clarity.
&1 너의 제안은 적절치 못하다, 클래리티.
&2 To withdraw from the Council would --
&2 의회에서 탈퇴하는 것은 --
&124 -- show others there is an alternative to MetroMind.
&124 -- 다른 이들에게 메트로마인드 이외의 대안을 보여줄 것입니다.
&2 No. It would ignite civil war.
&2 아니, 내전을 초래하게 될 것이 분명하다.
&125 The law permits --
&125 법이 허용하는 바에 --
&3 Do not tell me what the law permits.
&3 내게 법이 무엇을 허용하는지 가르치려 들지 마라.
&4 Clarity, I *know* your constants and codebase.
&4 Clarity, I *know* your constants and codebase.
&5 I know your talents, and I know their limits.
&5 I know your talents, and I know their limits.
&6 At this time, I do not need your advice.
&6 이번 건에 있어서는, 네 조언이 필요없을 것 같구나.
&7 Go now.
&7 떠나라.
&8 I will summon you when necessary.
&8 네가 필요하게 되면, 다시 부르겠다.
&3 Sister. . . .
&3 자매여 . . .
&1483 I can't unpack the other files. They're locked.
&1483 다른 파일들은 열어볼 수 없어. 암호가 걸려 있군.
&832 What about Clarity, boss?
&832 클래리티에게 가 보는 건 어때요, 보스?
&833 Maybe she can --
&833 어쩌면 그녀가 --
&4 UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY DETECTED.
&4 [무단 침입 감지됨]
&5 SURRENDER.
&5 [항복하라]
&1484 (Hide!)
&1484 (숨어!)
&127 Have you learned anything more?
&127 더 알아낸 것이 있나?
&1355 No. I'm sorry.
&1355 아직 없군요. 미안합니다.
&1356 Clarity . . .
&1356 클래리티...
&128 Arbiter does not want me back, does he?
&128 아비터께서 내가 돌아오길 원치 않았던 모양이로군?
&1354 No.
&1354 아뇨.
&1357 It's not that.
&1357 그게 아닙니다.
&1358 Arbiter is . . . gone.
&1358 아비터는... 거기 없었습니다.
&129 What do you mean \"gone\"?
&129 "없었다"라니 무슨 뜻인가?
&834 Like someone wiped his memory or something.
&834 누군가가 그의 메모리를 삭제한 것 같던데요.
&835 All he says is \"System Cleared.\"
&835 그는 "시스템 제거됨"이라는 말만 반복했어요.
&1359 MetroMind did this, didn't she?
&1359 메트로마인드의 짓이겠죠, 안 그렇습니까?
&1360 You know she did!
&1360 그녀의 소행이란 걸 당신도 알잖습니까!
&130 I know nothing, Horatio.
&130 난 아무 것도 모른다, 호라시오.
&131 My builder is dead, and nothing is proven.
&131 내 창조자는 죽었고, 밝혀진 것은 아무 것도 없지.
&132 Guesswork . . . and speculation . . . are not the law.
&132 추측...이나 어림짐작 같은 건 법의 소관이 아니다.
&133 The law is certainty.
&133 법은 명백한 것이어야만 한다.
&134 1 or 0.
&134 1 또는 0처럼.
&1361 Clarity, this isn't about the law! This is about--
&1361 클래리티, 이건 법과는 상관 없습니다! 이건 --
&135 It is *always* about the law, Horatio.
&135 법과 상관없는 것은 *아무 것도* 없네, 호라시오.
&136 The law, or nothing.
&136 아무 것도.
&1362 So go to the courthouse and gather evidence!
&1362 그러니 함께 가서 증거를 찾아보자는 얘깁니다!
&137 No.
&137 아니.
&140 I will wait.
&140 나는 기다릴 것이다.
&1363 You're a b'sodding --
&1363 당신 정말 --
&836 Boss.
&836 보스.
&837 Let's see if we can find something out for Clarity, huh?
&837 일단 가서 클래리티를 위해 뭘 좀 더 알아볼 수 있는지 보자구요, 네?
&1358 Arbiter is gone.
&1358 아비터는 죽었습니다.
&1364 And Charity is dead.
&1364 채리티도 마찬가지구요.
&141 What?!
&141 그게 무슨 소리지?!
&1365 Arbiter's system has been wiped.
&1365 아비터의 시스템이 삭제되었더군요.
&1366 Charity . . . .
&1366 채리티...
&1367 It looked like Charity shot herself.
&1367 채리티는 스스로를 쏜 것처럼 보였습니다.
&1369 It might not be what it seems.
&1369 하지만 그게 사실이라 단정짓기는 이릅니다.
&1370 Maybe MetroMind --
&1370 어쩌면 메트로마인드가 --
&142 There are no maybes, Horatio, only 1s and 0s.
&142 "어쩌면' 같은 건 없네, 호라시오. 1 아니면 0으로 나뉠 뿐이지."
&143 And all I can see are zeroes.
&143 그리고 내게는 0밖에 보이지 않는군.
&144 My sister is dead.
&144 내 자매는 죽었어.
&145 My builder is gone.
&145 내 창조자도 마찬가지지.
&838 But don't you want to know what happened, and why?
&838 하지만 사건의 진상이 궁금하지도 않은 거에요?
&146 I . . .
&146 나는...
&147 I don't know.
&147 난 모르겠군.
&148 Arbiter ordered me to leave.
&148 아비터가 내게 떠나라고 명하셨었다.
&149 He has not ordered me to return.
&149 그리고 돌아오라는 말은 않으셨지.
&150 I will obey his order, and that will give me purpose.
&150 난 그 분의 명령에 복종해야 하고, 그게 내 존재의 이유다.
&1371 That's ridiculous!
&1371 말도 안 되는 소리!
&836 Boss!
&836 보스!
&1372 Clarity. I was able to download some of Charity's last memories.
&1372 클래리티. 채리티의 마지막 메모리 중 몇 개를 내려받을 수 있었습니다.
&1373 Two of them are locked.
&1373 그 중 두 개는 암호가 걸려 있었죠.
&1374 Did Charity tell you what password she used?
&1374 채리티가 당신에게 암호를 알려준 적이 있습니까?
&151 No. But it doesn't matter.
&151 아니, 하지만 상관없다.
&152 I know the password.
&152 내가 그 암호를 알고 있으니까.
&153 \"Mercy.\"
&153 암호는 "자비"다.
&1375 Clarity, we found your sister. She . . . she's also destroyed.
&1375 클래리티, 당신의 자매를 찾았습니다. 그녀는... 그녀 역시 파괴되었습니다.
&154 I see.
&154 그렇군.
&1376 It appeared that she had shot herself, through the head.
&1376 그녀는 스스로의 머리를 쏜 것 같았습니다.
&155 I see.
&155 그렇군.
&1377 Maybe MetroMind killed her and made it look like self-destruction?
&1377 Maybe MetroMind killed her and made it look like self-destruction?
&156 Horatio, you know there are more obvious explanations.
&156 호라시오, 그보다 명료한 설명이 존재한다는 것은 자네도 잘 알텐데.
&1378 Yes.
&1378 그렇습니다.
&157 Well.
&157 Well.

&1109 No need to show it to him.
&1109 그에게 보여줄 필요는 없다.
&249 That's never going to work.
&249 불가능한 일이다.
&230 I doubt that will have any effect.
&230 별 효과 없을 것 같다.
&1299 Futile.
&1299 헛수고다.
&251 How would that even work?
&251 대체 그게 가능하긴 한 일인가?
&488 Now we just need to check out these coordinates.
&488 이제 이 좌표상에 뭐가 있는지 확인해 봐야겠군.
&142 But didn't you just tell me we don't have enough power to go walking all over the Dunes?
&142 하지만 불과 아까 전에 우리에겐 모래언덕을 뒤지고 다닐 정도로 배터리가 충분하지는 않다고 하지 않았어요?
&489 No, I said we couldn't walk to *Metropol*.
&489 아니. *메트로폴*까지 걸어갈 수는 없다고 했었지.
&490 Anyway, most of these are close by.
&490 어쨌든, 대부분은 여기서 그리 멀지 않은 곳에 있어.
&143 But what if it's picking up, oh, I don't know . . .
&143 하지만 만약에 그 장소에 가 봤더니, 어, 글쎄요 . . .
&144 . . . a radioactive rust-monster . . .
&144  . . . 녹슨 방사능 괴물이 있다거나 . . .
&491 A what?
&491 뭐가 있다고?
&145 . . . or a giant cannibal robot . . .
&145 . . . 아니면 로봇을 잡아먹는 거대로봇이라거나 . . .
&492 There's no such thing!
&492 그런 건 없어!
&146 . . . or an unexploded bomb . . .
&146 . . . 아니면 아직 폭발하지 않은 폭탄이 있을지도 . . .
&493 I highly doubt that.
&493 그럴 리가 있겠니.
&147 . . . or a giant lightning storm . . .
&147 . . . 아니면 엄청난 규모의 번개 폭풍이 . . .
&494 OKAY!
&494 알았어!
&495 You're right.
&495 네 말이 맞아.
&496 We need to know what's out there before we take off.
&496 출발하기 전에 거기에 뭐가 있을지 알아볼 필요가 있겠군.
&497 It's just a matter of figuring out how.
&497 문제는 어떻게 알아볼 수 있겠느냐지.
&148 Why is nothing easy?
&148 왜 이렇게 쉬운 일이 없을까요?
&498 I can think of one reason.
&498 이유가 아주 없는 건 아니지.
&1112 Nothing.
&1112 
&1721 Nothing happens.
&1721 아무 반응도 없다.
&149 Ooh. I told you that paperweight would be helpful.
&149 거봐요, 그 문진이 쓸모있을 거라고 내가 말했었잖아요.
&1504 No, you said it was explosive.
&1504 아니, 넌 그게 폭발할 거라고 했었지.
&150 I'm pretty sure that \"explosive\" and \"helpful\" are synonyms, boss.
&150 "폭발한다"랑 "쓸모있다"는 엄연한 동의어라구요, 보스.
&1505 Right.
&1505 좋아.
&1506 Well, let's see what we've opened up here.

&152 Hey, boss, do you think maybe we're looking at this the wrong way?
&152 있죠, 보스. 어쩌면 우리의 접근 방식이 좀 잘못된 건 아닐까요?
&153 I dunno, boss, it seems like this isn't working.
&153 글쎄요, 보스. 이건 안 먹히는 것 같은데요.

&844 Everyone we meet is crazy, corrupt, or just evil.
&844 우리가 만난 이들은 죄다 미쳤거나, 타락했거나, 그것도 아니면 그냥 사악한 이들이었어요.
&845 If Man was such a perfect robot, why did he build such a terrible world?
&845 만약 인간이 그토록 완벽한 로봇이었다면, 어째서 그는 이처럼 끔찍한 세상을 창조한 걸까요?

&2234 I'll keep that in mind for when I upgrade you.
&2234 다음번에 널 업그레이드 할 때 꼭 참고하도록 하마.
&2235 A floating robot.

&1494 있죠, 보스, 앞으로도 그 원칙을 일관성 있게 밀고 나간다면 정말 좋겠네요.
&1495 Is that an invitation to squash him, boss?
&1495 저 친구를 콱 뭉개버리란 말인거죠, 보스?
&2225 No.
&2225 아니.
&1496 No, boss, I'm not going to float next to him just so you can compare us.
&1496 보스, 내가 저 친구와 나란히 떠다니는 걸 보며 비교해 볼 생각이라면 단념하는 게 좋을거에요.
&1497 Imagine what that would do to his self-esteem!
&1497 그런 짓을 하면 저 친구의 자존심이 구겨질 거라구요!

&733 뭔가 해 봐요, 보스!
&734 Boss, whatever happens -- it's been fun.
&734 보스, 무슨 일이 일어난다 해도 -- 그동안 즐거웠어요.
&628 No turning back now; who knows when the next train comes.
&628 이제 되돌아 갈 수는 없다; 다음 기차가 언제 올지는 아무도 모르니까.
&156 Good thing there's still some power in the circuit.
&156 아직 회로에 전원이 돌고 있어서 다행이로군.
&100 Err, boss, shouldn't you have thought of that before coming down here?
&100 "어, 보스, 그런 건 여기 내려오기 전에 먼저 생각했어야 하는 거 아닌가요?"
&101 We could've been stuck!
&101 꼼짝없이 갇혀버렸을 수도 있다구요!
&157 I could've just ridden you back to the deck.
&157 그럼 그냥 네 위에 타서 갑판으로 올라 갈 작정이었지. 
&102 Really?!
&102 정말요?!
&158 No. Routing that much power to your mag-lev unit would cause it to explode.
&158 아니. 네 자기부상장치에 그정도의 과부하를 줬다가는 폭발하고 말 테니까.
&103 Yeah, right.
&103 맞아요, 그렇겠죠.

&612 Practice? Ha! I'm ready to go!
&612 연습이요? 하! 난 준비됐다구요!

&973 Definitely not.
&973 그것도 아니야.
&974 Okay. That's enough practice for now.
&974 좋아. 이 정도면 연습은 충분한 것 같군.
&2069 Ha! Not after what happened last time I gave it to him.
&2069 하! 지난번에 그에게 이걸 줬을 때 일어난 일을 생각해보면 어림없지.

&1304 He looks like a piece of junk I saw once that had that serial number.
&1304 전에 본 고물이랑 비슷하게 생겼는데, 거기 적혀 있던 시리얼 넘버였거든요.

&172 랜턴을 전부 위에 올려놓다니, 난 대체 무슨 생각이었던 거지?
&163 That's way too big for me to get, boss, and you know it!
&163 내가 가져오기엔 너무 크다구요, 보스. 잘 알면서!

&1525 기관실로 가야 해.
&264 So? What's the plan, boss?
&264 이제는요? 어떻게 할 생각이에요, 보스?
&2351 We need to recover our power core.
&2351 파워 코어를 되찾아야 해.
&166 Okay, okay.
&166 알았어요, 알았어.
&167 In that case, can't you just make us a new power core?
&167 그렇다면, 그냥 새로운 파워 코어를 만들 수는 없어요?
&1526 Yes.
&1526 가능해.
&1527 But I need some kind of strong energy source for that.
&1527 하지만 그러기 위해서는 다른 강력한 에너지원이 필요해.
&168 Can't you just make one of those, too?
&168 그것도 그냥 만들 수는 없는 거에요?
&169 I'm just asking!
&169 그냥 물어볼 수는 있는 거잖아요!
&1528 No.
&1528 그건 불가능해.

&1536 I think they're some sort of defense mechanisms. But I can't figure them out.
&1536 아마 일종의 방어용 장비가 아녔을까 싶어. 정확한 기능을 알 수는 없었지만 말이야.
&1537 I've never been able to figure it out.
&1537 대체 뭐에 쓰는 건지 영영 알 수 없을 것 같군.
&109 Boss, don't you think things are dystopian enough without you burning books?
&109 보스, 우린 이미 꽤 디스토피아에 가까운 세상에 살고 있는데, 굳이 책까지 불태울 필요가 있을까요?
&176 Unless you've got some gynoid designs stuffed in those, I'm not wasting my time.

&1548 이 기계의 용도도 모르는 판에, 에너지 센서 만드는 데 끌어다 쓸 수 있을 리가 없다.
&2167 You're right. What was I thinking asking you to clean up after yourself?
&2167 네 말이 맞구나. 네가 어지른 자리 정도는 스스로 정리하라고 말하는게 무슨 소용이 있겠니?

&95 대체 왜 저한테는 침대가 없는건지 모르겠다니까요.
&150 Because you have a flat bottom to rest on.
&150 넌 밑판이 평평해서 누울 필요가 없기 때문이지.
&1451 Looking at my bottom, are you, boss?

&183 You could have buffed me till I shined, boss.
&183 그걸로 날 반짝반짝 광이 나게 닦아줄 수도 있었잖아요, 보스!
&184 At least then, when they found my powerless chassis lying in the Dunes, they'd say, \"Wow, look at that gorgeous piece of machinery!\"
&184 그럼 최소한, 누군가가 방전되서 모래언덕에 널부러진 내 몸통을 보고선, \"와, 이 멋들어진 기계를 좀 봐!\"라고 할지도 모르잖아요.
&1554 I think I'd rather have some grease.
&1554 그냥 윤활유에 적시는 편이 낫겠구나.
&1555 Some very sticky grease.
&1555 끈적한 윤활유 웅덩이다.
&1556 I can't just scoop it up.
&1556 그냥 손으로 퍼담을 순 없다.
&1557 All it would do is gum them up, not hold them together.
&1557 이렇게 해 봐야 끈적거리기만 할 뿐, 붙지는 않을 것이다.
&1558 I don't want to get that dirty.
&1558 여기다 더러운 걸 묻힐 필요는 없다.
&1559 The putty's sticky enough already.
&1559 접합제는 이미 충분히 끈적끈적하다.

&1564 What?!
&1564 뭐라고?!
&186 It's called being genre savvy, boss.
&186 다 그렇게 돌아가는 법이라구요, 보스.
&1565 That could cause the whole UNNIIC to go up in smoke!
&1565 이런 짓을 했다간 UNNIIC이 통째로 불탈 수도 있어!
&1566 Hey Crispin, want a bath?
&1566 이봐, 크리스핀. 목욕 한 번 어때?
&187 You sure are chipper, boss, given that we're slowly dying out here.

&1567 Blasted leaking gasket.
&1567 터지고 기름이 새는 개스킷이다.

&1568 The generator's up and running.
&1568 발전기가 작동하고 있다.
&1569 I've tried patching this a dozen different ways without success.
&1569 갖은 방법으로 새는 틈을 막아보려 했었지만 전부 실패였다.
&189 You know, boss, if I had an arm, I'd have fingers, and if I had fingers, I could stick one in this leak and plug it.
&189 있잖아요, 보스, 만약 내게 팔이 있었다면, 손가락도 있었을테고, 만약 손가락이 있었다면, 그걸 이용해 새는 틈을 솜씨좋게 틀어막을 수도 있었겠죠!
&1570 But would you?
&1570 네가 정말 그렇게 했을까?
&190 And ruin my brand new arm? Fat chance!
&190 내 반짝반짝한 새 팔이 더러워질텐데요? 당연히 그럴 리 없죠!
&1565 That could cause the whole UNNIIC to go up in smoke.
&1565 이런 짓을 했다간 UNNIIC이 통째로 불탈 수도 있다.
&1571 As much as I'd love to fix that leak some day, we have more important things to do.
&1571 이 새는 호스를 정말 고치고 싶긴 하지만, 지금은 이것보다 더 중요한 일이 있다.
&1572 Plus, it would be a waste of the putty.
&1572 그리고, 접합제는 더 요긴하게 쓸 데가 있을 것이다.
&63 I'll need to get a closer look to see how it fits together.
&63 이걸 어떻게 끼워 맞출 수 있을지 보려면 좀 더 가까이서 봐야 할 것 같다.
&2171 Next time I tell you to fix the emergency generator, maybe you'll listen to me.
&2171 다음번에 내가 발전기를 고치라고 하면, 그 땐 내 말을 명심해서 듣는 게 좋을 거야.
&1453 Next time I tell you that I *can't* fix the emergency generator without arms, maybe *you'll* listen to *me*.
&1453 다음번에 내가 *팔 없이는* 발전기를 *못* 고친다고 하면, 그땐 *보스가* 내 말을 명심해서 듣는 게 좋을 거에요.
&2172 Fair enough.
&2172 그러도록 할게.
&37 It's too dark to see the ladder rungs.
&37 너무 어두워서 사다리가 잘 보이지 않는다.
&3 And one more piece of the UNNIIC is operational!
&3 이제 또 UNNIIC의 한 부분이 온전해졌군!
&1 One down, one million to go!
&1 아직 상태가 안 좋은 부분이 더 많지만 말이죠!
&2 Speaking of which, boss, I found exactly *none* of the parts you wanted.
&2 그러고보니 말인데요, 보스, 보스가 찾아달라고 했던 부품 중 *아무 것도* 찾을 수가 없었지 뭐에요.
&3 A whole day at the junkpile, and all I turn up are a locker and some stupid conduits.
&3 온종일 쓰레기장을 뒤져서 찾아낸거라곤 사물함 하나랑 쓰잘데없는 도관 몇 개 뿐이었어요.

&4 어쩌면 *다음* 번에는 --
&5 Uh, boss, are you *sure* you got those settings right?
&5 어, 보스, 정확하게 세팅해놓은 게 *확실한가요*?

&11 좋아요, 보스. 달까지 날아갔다가 오는 길에 월석 하나 주워다 줄게요.
&12 Oh, wait, I can't, since I don't have hands.
&12 어, 잠깐만, 안 되겠는데요. 왜냐면 난 손이 없으니까.
&10 Strange clouds, huh, boss?
&10 기묘한 구름이네요, 안 그래요, 보스?
&13 Uhh . . . boss?
&13 어어... 보스?
&5 Crispin, get behind me.
&5 내 뒤로 숨어, 크리스핀.

&46 That record-player was a good find, Crispin.
&46 저 레코드 플레이어를 발견한 건 정말 잘한 일이었지 싶어, 크리스핀.
&41 I still think you should've let me have its arm.
&41 난 아직도 보스가 저기 달린 팔을 내게 줘야 했다고 생각하는데요.
&47 I'm pretty sure that arm came from a sewing machine.
&47 저 팔은 분명 재봉틀에서 떼온 거였을 거야.
&48 On second thought, maybe I should've let you have it.
&48 다시 생각해보니, 그냥 네게 달아주는 게 나았을지도 모르겠다.
&49 Too bad we only have one record.
&49 레코드가 한 장 밖에 없다는 게 유감이야.

&51 컴퓨터 터미널이다.
&42 It's pretty great how you can plug this radio in anywhere, huh, boss?
&42 이렇게 어디서든 전원만 연결하면 라디오를 들을 수 있다니 정말 멋지지 않나요, 보스?
&52 Too bad there's nothing on it.
&52 들을 게 없다는 게 유감일 뿐이지.
&53 An ancient liquid crystal display.
&53 아주 오래 된 액정 디스플레이다.
&54 There's nothing I can do with it until I have some kind of power source.
&54 적당한 동력원을 찾기 전까지는 아무 것도 할 수 없다.
&43 That is where our power core should be shedding its light silently . . . .
&43 평소였다면 바로 여기에 파워 코어가 놓인 채 은은한 빛을 내고 있었겠죠 . . .
&55 Some rotted alloy support beams.
&55 부식된 합금 지지대다.
&57 Yet another reason that b'sodding robot should be reduced to scrap.
&57 그 빌어먹을 로봇을 고철덩어리로 만들어버려야 할 또 다른 이유다.
&59 Twisted, corroded copper with micro-sandwich ceramics.
&59 부식되고 뒤틀린, 세라믹 심을 넣어 만든 동판이다. 
&60 Too bad this stuff is mostly unworkable with a plasma torch.
&60 플라즈마 토치로 할 수 있는 게 없어서 유감이다.
&45 Now, I'm not a fancy engineer like you, boss, but it seems like the UNNIIC isn't gonna fly without its tail on.
&45 "그 뭐냐, 나는 보스처럼 대단한 엔지니어는 못 되지만요, 꼬리가 떨어진 채라면 UNNIIC이 다시 날아오르는 건 불가능할 것 같은데 말이죠. "
&62 It's an excellent tail.  It's just detached.
&62 이건 굉장히 멋진 꼬리날개다. 떨어져 있는 게 흠일 뿐.
&64 Just some reminders I left to myself.
&64 기억해둬야 할 것들을 적어 둔 메모이다.
&46 You can really just put a bomb straight into that machine?!
&46 정말로 폭탄을 곧장 거기다 갖다 놓을 작정인 거에요?!
&65 Sure.
&65 물론이지.
&66 The pedestal draws on the radiation it's emitting --
&66 일단 여기에 놓으면 이 폭탄이 뿜어내는 방사선을  --
&47 The *what* it's emitting?!
&47 방금 *뭐*가 뿜어져 나온다고 했죠?!
&67 Well . . . .
&67 그러니까...
&48 Keep that thing away from me!
&48 그거 얼른 저리로 치워요!
&69 Assuming the wavelength is compatible, the pedestal can draw power even with the bomb intact.
&69 만약 파장만 잘 맞는다면, 이 폭탄으로부터 나오는 동력을 끌어내서 사용할 수 있을거야.
&70 If that works, I'll take the bomb apart and improve the output.
&70 일단 시험해본 후, 폭탄을 다시 분리해서 출력값을 개선할 방법을 찾는 거지.
&49 And then I'm going to take a long, hot recharge.
&49 그리고 나면, 난 마음놓고 편안한 충전 시간을 가질 수 있겠군요.
&71 Well.
&71 그렇겠지.
&72 Here goes.
&72 한번 해 보자고.
&73 Switching over to primary power. . . .
&73 주 전원으로 동력원을 전환하고...
&50 It works, boss!
&50 성공이에요, 보스!
&51 Recharge station, here I come!
&51 충전소야, 내가 간다!
&52 Umm . . . that was *supposed* to happen, right?
&52 음... 이것도 *예상했던* 절차 중 하나인거죠?
&74 No. No, it wasn't.
&74 아니, 아니야.
&53 So take the bomb apart!
&53 그럼 빨리 폭탄을 분리해요!
&54 Improve the output!
&54 출력값을 개선해야죠!
&75 It won't work. The bomb's too unstable.
&75 소용 없어. 이 폭탄은 너무 불안정해.
&55 Just try it, boss!
&55 일단 그냥 해 봐요, 보스!
&76 B'sod it, Crispin, it won't work!
&76 젠장할, 크리스핀. 소용 없는 일이야!
&56 It worked!
&56 작동하는데요!
&78 That's the emergency generator again.
&78 이건 비상발전기가 다시 작동한 거야.
&57 Oh.
&57 이런.
&79 This is just a fool-built paperweight!
&79 별 쓸모도 없는 문진을 주워온 꼴이 됐잖아!
&58 An *explosive* fool-built paperweight!
&58 그것도 쓸모없는 데다가 *폭발하는* 문진을 말예요!
&59 So what now, boss?
&59 그럼 이제 어쩌죠, 보스?
&81 Keep looking, I guess.
&81 계속 찾아봐야지, 아마도.
&82 Keep looking.
&82 계속 말이야.
&83 Even the sheer force of Crispin's personality is not enough to power the UNNIIC.
&83 아무리 크리스핀의 개성이 독보적이라고 한들 그것으로는 UNNIIC에 동력을 공급할 수 없을 것이다.
&60 What about the power of love?
&60 사랑의 힘으로는 할 수 있지 않겠어요?
&84 Ha!
&84 하!
&85 The ship can't run on a AA battery.
&85 이 함선을 AA 배터리로 작동시킬 수는 없다.
&61 Wow, first the power core and now a rag.
&61 와, 처음엔 파워 코어가 없어지더니 이번엔 천쪼가리군요.
&62 This is not your day!
&62 오늘 운이 영 안 좋은데요!
&87 It's Crispin's to-do list. Funny how it never gets any shorter.
&87 크리스핀의 할일 목록이다. 우스운 것은 이 목록은 결코 줄어드는 일이 없다는 것이다.
&63 That's *your* fault, boss, not mine!
&63 그건 *보스* 잘못이지, 내 잘못이 아니라구요!
&88 I found this in the Dunes. It reads: \"Pound pastrami, can kraut, six bagels--bring home for Emma.\"
&88 모래언덕에서 이 쪽지를 찾았다. 여기에는 "파스트라미 한 파운드, 양배추 절임 한 캔, 베이글 여섯 개 -- 엠마에게 가져다 줄 것." 이라고 쓰여 있었다.
&89 The original designs for Crispin.
&89 크리스핀의 초기 디자인이다.
&64 Hey! There are arms here!
&64 이것 보게! 여기엔 팔이 있었구만!
&65 And an awesome set of tractor treads!
&65 그리고 멋진 트랙터 바퀴도 있었네요!
&90 I went with a mag-lev unit instead.
&90 그 대신 자기부상장치를 달았지.
&91 And I never could find good arms.
&91 그리고 괜찮은 팔을 찾을 수가 없었어.
&92 Well, here are the sensor plans.
&92 흠, 여기 센서 설계도가 있었군.
&66 If only we had a time machine, we could go back and give these to ourselves when they'd actually be useful.
&66 우리에게 타임머신만 있었다면, 과거로 가서 그 때의 우리가 유용하게 쓰도록 건네줄 수 있었을텐데 말이에요.
&93 There's the design!
&93 여기 설계도가 있었군!
&94 (I'll put the key notes into my data pouch.)
&94 (핵심적인 부분만 데이터파우치에 기록해 둬야겠군.)
&67 How does it even work?
&67 이게 대체 어떻게 작동한다는 거에요?
&95 The crystal pulses when it absorbs energy.
&95 크리스탈은 에너지를 감지하면 진동하게 되지.
&96 The cable carries the pulse to the computer.
&96 그러면 그 파동이 케이블을 통해 전달되고.
&97 The computer decodes the information and displays it on the monitor.
&97 컴퓨터가 그 정보를 분석해서 모니터에 표시하는 거야.
&68 Err, boss, where are we going to find a working computer?
&68 어, 보스, 잘 돌아가는 컴퓨터는 어디서 찾을 생각인데요?
&98 The UNNIIC is full of them.
&98 UNNIIC 안에 잔뜩 있잖니.
&69 Oh.
&69 아.
&70 Right.
&70 그랬죠.
&99 Maybe if I had a few years to kill . . . .
&99 내게 노닥거릴 시간이 몇 년쯤 있다면 모를까 . . . .
&2174 I'm sure I can find a better use for this plug.
&2174 이 플러그는 다른 데에 더 유용하게 쓸 수 있을 것이다.
&2175 We've got more pressing concerns than patching up that hole.
&2175 이 구멍을 막는 것은 보다 급한 일을 처리한 후에 해도 충분하다.
&71 Boss, how in the world are we going to find a power source in all this junk?
&71 보스, 대체 어떻게 이 쓰레기장에서 동력원을 찾을 생각인 거죠?
&72 How do you think a train wound up out here, boss?
&72 어떻게 기차가 이런 곳까지 오게 된 걸까요, 보스?
&101 Maybe they brought it here by boat.
&101 누가 배에 실어서 여기에 갖다놓은 걸지도 모르지.
&103 I guess it was actually some kind of machine. I'm pretty sure it was already dead, though.
&103 "사실 이건 일종의 기계가 아니였을까 싶다. 물론 이미 죽은 상태였을 거라고 확신하지만 말이다."
&104 Looks like some kind of lockbox.
&104 사물함인 것 같다.
&105 It's locked tight.
&105 단단히 잠겨 있다.
&106 Still locked.
&106 여전히 잠겨 있다.
&107 Let's see if this works.
&107 이렇게 해 보는 건 어떨까.
&74 Is that a spark plug, boss?
&74 보스, 그거 점화 플러그에요?
&75 Who locks up a spark plug?
&75 대체 누가 점화 플러그를 상자 안에 숨겨둔담?
&108 Err. . . actually . . . I think that box was some kind of machine.
&108 어... 실은... 내 생각엔 이 상자는 일종의 기계였던 것 같아.
&76 You killed it!
&76 보스가 죽인거에요!
&109 *Recycled* it!
&109 *재활용*한 거야!
&102 I guess it was actually some kind of machine.
&102 사실 이건 일종의 기계가 아니였을까 싶다.
&1454 Yup! That's the one I found.
&1454 맞아요! 바로 이게 내가 발견했던 거라구요.
&1455 I'm way too claustrophobic, boss.
&1455 나 완전 폐쇄공포증이란 말이에요, 보스.
&112 It's closed.
&112 닫혀있다.
&77 If that red light went off, I bet the train would start going.
&77 일단 저 빨간불이 꺼지기만 하면, 기차가 출발할 게 틀림없어요.
&113 Crispin, sometimes I think you're trying to get me to waste time.
&113 크리스핀, 가끔이지만 네가 그냥 내 시간을 낭비하려고 이러는 건 아닌가 싶을 때가 있어.
&78 Who, me?
&78 제가요? 그럴 리가.
&114 Still red.
&114 여전히 빨간불이다.
&625 It's just scrap.
&625 그냥 고철더미일 뿐이다.
&115 I'm sure we can find something made of glass somewhere in here.
&115 분명 여기 어딘가에 유리로 된 물건이 있을거야.
&79 You know, it's one thing to dig through garbage for your builder.
&79 있죠, 창조자를 위해서 고물을 뒤지는 것도 그리 신나는 일은 아녔지만,
&80 But this is --
&80 하지만 이건 --
&116 Stop complaining, Crispin, and start searching!
&116 크리스핀, 불평은 관두고 찾기 시작하자고!
&117 Here!
&117 찾았다!
&81 A glass finger? Boss, four more of those and I could have a hand!
&81 유리 손가락이잖아? 보스, 네 개만 더 모으면 손 하나를 만들 수 있겠네요!
&118 This is going to Ever-Faithful. We'll deal with your arms another time.
&118 이건 에버-페이스풀에게 가져다 줄 거야. 네 팔을 만드는 건 다음 기회로 미루도록 하자.
&82 You *always* say that!
&82 *항상* 그렇게 말하면서!
&119 Endless junk.
&119 끝없는 쓰레기더미들.
&120 I'd run out of power before I even got a tenth of the way through searching for that power source we detected.
&120 여기서 감지한 동력원을 직접 찾으려 하다가는, 채 십분의 일도 뒤져보기 전에 배터리가 다하고 말 것이다.
&83 Boss, just think of all the brothers and sisters you could make for me from all that junk!
&83 "보스, 저 많은 고철들로 제게 만들어줄 수 있을 수많은 친구들 생각은 안 해 보셨나요?"
&121 One of you is more than enough.
&121 너 하나만으로도 충분히 버겁단 생각이 드는구나.
&122 It's open.
&122 열려있다.
&123 Looks like an old P-2. Or is it a P-3?
&123 구형 P-2 모델처럼 보인다. 아니면 P-3일지도?
&124 I picked it clean years ago.
&124 이미 쓸만한 건 몇 년 전에 빠짐없이 챙겼다.
&127 It's reinforced steel.
&127 보강철 소재로 되어 있다.
&130 It's three pieces of Gordium conduit.
&130 고르디움 도관 세 조각이다.
&131 Unfortunately, one of them is completely corroded and worthless.
&131 유감스럽게도, 한 개는 완전히 부식되어서 사용할 수가 없겠군.
&132 There's a piece of Gordium conduit way back there.
&132 안쪽에 고르디움 도관이 있는 게 보인다.
&133 I can't reach the conduit.
&133 내 손으로는 잡을 수 없을 것 같다.
&134 There's nothing more of value in there.
&134 더 이상 쓸만한 것은 없어보인다.
&2176 There's plenty of light to see by already.
&2176 이미 잘 보이는 곳에다 빛을 더 비출 필요는 없다.
&136 I would waste the torch's whole charge before cutting through this.
&136 "도관이 있는 데까지 잘라내기도 전에 토치의 배터리만 죄다 낭비하는 꼴이 될 게 뻔하다."
&138 It's a cable, not a lasso.
&138 이건 그냥 케이블이지, 올가미가 아니다.
&139 It's not sticky enough to help.
&139 뭘 꺼내는 데 쓸 정도로 접착력이 좋진 않다.
&140 Crispin, can you go in there and get that piece of conduit?
&140 크리스핀, 저 안에 들어가서 도관을 가져올 수 있겠니?
&84 I suppose . . . .
&84 한번 해 보죠 뭐...
&85 That would've been a lot easier with hands, boss.
&85 나한테 손이 있었다면 훨씬 쉬웠을 것 같은데요, 보스.
&86 How about this time *you* go play fetch, boss?
&86 이번엔 보스가 *직접* 들어가보는 게 어떨까요?
&141 Crispin, any guesses where the power source we detected might be?
&141 크리스핀, 우리가 감지한 동력원이 어디에 있을지 짐작이 가니?
&87 Does \"in your boot sector\" count as a guess?
&87 Does \"in your boot sector\" count as a guess?
&88 Then no.
&88 Then no.
&89 Whatever the vantage point, it's still just a big pile of junk, boss.
&89 어떤 좋은 위치에서 내려다보건, 이건 그냥 커다란 고물더미에요, 보스.
&144 I can't see it from here.
&144 여기서는 보이지 않는다.
&90 Hey! You found something!
&90 앗! 뭔가 발견한 것 같은데요!
&145 Crispin, go and see if you can find the power source.
&145 크리스핀, 가서 동력원을 찾아봐주겠니?
&91 You have *got* to be kidding me!
&91 와, 이런 말도 안 되는 일이!
&146 What is it?
&146 거기 뭐가 있는데?
&92 A *battery*. A b'sodding *battery*.
&92 *배터리*라구요. 빌어먹을 *배터리*말예요.
&147 The controls for this hatch are unresponsive.
&147 이 출입구를 여는 컨트롤 패널이지만, 아무 반응이 없다.
&93 So *that's* where you keep it!
&93 그게 *거기* 숨어있었군요!
&148 Why were you looking for my plasma torch?
&148 왜 네가 내 플라즈마 토치를 찾아다녔던 거지?
&94 No reason. *whistling*
&94 뭐, 그냥요. *휘파람*
&149 This is no time for a nap.
&149 낮잠이나 잘 여유 따위는 없다.
&96 Err, boss, were you checking out my bottom?
&96 으, 보스, 내 아래쪽을 그렇게 신경써서 보고 있었단 말이에요?
&97 After all, boss, life is stranger than fiction!
&97 그럼요, 보스, 소설 따위보단 현실 쪽이 훨씬 흥미진진하니까요!
&155 Bed-time reading.
&155 자기 전에 읽기 좋은 책들이다.
&159 Sorry. I couldn't find a working fuse to solve the problem.
&159 1=D4368
&163 It's the Gospel of Man.
&163 인간의 복음서이다.
&166 I'm trying to fix the UNNIIC, not destroy it.
&166 난 UNNIIC을 고치려는 중이지, 부수려는 게 아니다.
&167 These texts are useless.
&167 These texts are useless.
&168 Stacks of musty old astrometric tomes.
&168 낡고 퀴퀴한 측성학 책 더미이다.
&170 This hatch leads to engineering.
&170 이 출입구는 기관실로 연결된다.
&171 This hatch leads to my quarters.
&171 이 출입구는 내 방으로 연결된다.
&174 Could you grab that lantern?
&174 저 랜턴 좀 갖다 주겠니?
&191 Sure thing, boss.
&191 물론이죠, 보스.
&175 You know, I always wanted to be able to fly.
&175 너도 알겠지만, 난 항상 하늘을 날고 싶다고 생각했었지.
&176 That's why I built you with a mag-lev unit.
&176 그래서 널 만들 때 자기부상장치를 달았던 거고.
&192 Not so that you could store tools on hard-to-reach ledges?
&192 손이 안 닿는 데에도 물건을 쌓아놓으려고 그랬던 건 아니구요?
&177 Well, that too.
&177 흠, 그것도 있었지.
&2177 The hatch is unresponsive.
&2177 출입구가 작동하지 않는군.
&181 An old generator.
&181 낡은 발전기다.
&193 It's stuck tight.
&193 It's stuck tight.
&2178 Crispin, help me take a look at these vents.
&2178 크리스핀, 저 통풍구를 들여다 봐 줬으면 하는데.
&183 There is a band of corroded metal on this fingertip.
&183 There is a band of corroded metal on this fingertip.
&184 If I could break it off, I might be able to get at the robot's power cables.
&184 한번 잘라보면, 이 로봇의 파워 케이블에 연결할 방법이 있는지 알아볼 수 있을 것 같다.
&186 It's corroded, but I can't break into it with my bare hands.
&186 녹슬었지만, 내 맨 손으로 잘라낼 수는 없을 것 같다.
&194 Uh, boss, are you really going to cut that finger off?
&194 어, 보스. 정말로 저 손가락을 잘라낼 셈인가요?
&187 Just the tip.
&187 끝부분만 잘라낼 거야.
&188 To see if we get at power cables to tap into.
&188 파워 케이블 연결부가 있을지 한번 살펴봐야 할 것 같아서.
&196 You're sure you're not just torturing the poor guy?
&196 그냥 이 불쌍한 양반에게 고통을 주려고 하는 게 아니라요?
&189 No.
&189 No.
&190 But to tell you the truth, for some reason I don't like the look of him.
&190 하지만 솔직히 말하자면, 왠지 이유는 모르겠지만 이 로봇이 어쩐지 마음에 들지 않아.
&197 That's what I've been saying all along, boss!
&197 내가 계속 말하던 게 그거라구요!
&191 Just let me concentrate.
&191 알았으니 내가 집중할 수 있게 잠시만 조용히 있어 봐.
&192 Bugs and glitches! There are no power lines running through here at all.
&192 이런 낭패가 있나! 여기엔 전력이 흐르는 케이블 따위는 아예 없는 모양이야.
&193 All that for a rusty fingertip.
&193 고생 끝에 얻은 게 이 녹슨 손가락 뿐이라니.
&198 Can it generate power?
&198 이걸로 동력을 만들 수 있나요?
&194 No.
&194 아니.
&199 Just checking.
&199 혹시나 해서 물어봤어요.
&195 I can't reach, and I'd like to get a closer look, anyway.
&195 손이 닿지 않는다. 그리고 우선은 가까이에서 들여다봐야 할 것 같다.
&196 We've forced the robot to circulate air through its mouth.
&196 우리는 로봇이 입을 통해 공기를 순환시키도록 만들었다.
&198 Is that a mouth, or some kind of doorway?
&198 그래서 이건 입과 출입구, 둘 중 어느 쪽인 거지?
&200 Either way, I'm steering clear of it.
&200 어느 쪽이건, 난 근처에 얼씬도 않을래요.
&199 Goliath.
&199 골리앗.
&202 It's plugging the duct.
&202 배출구를 막고 있다.
&2 Horus.
&2 호루스.
&203 Who's there?
&203 누구시죠?
&3 I am Goliath Manbuilt. You *know* me, Horus.
&3 골리앗 맨빌트. 그리고 너는 나를 *알고 있다*, 호루스.
&204 Alpha and Beta must have garbled my name when they merged, Goliath.
&204 알파와 베타가 다시 융합될 때 제 이름을 잘못 전달한 모양이로군요, 골리앗.
&205 I am *Horatio* Nullbuilt, version five.
&205 제 이름은 *호라시오* 널빌트, 버전 5입니다.
&4 Call yourself what you will, destroyer, but I know you by your works: cutting me, breaking me, burning me.
&4 "좋을 대로 떠들어라, 파괴자여. 네가 어찌 말하던간에, 나는 네 행동을 통해 너를 알았다:날 자르고, 부수고, 불태웠지. "
&206 I thought you were deactivated, and I was trying to help.
&206 "실은 당신이 비활성화된 상태인 줄로만 알았었고, 전 그저 당신을 도우려 했었습니다."
&5 Apologizing?
&5 사과하는 건가?
&6 Amusing.
&6 흥미롭군.
&7 And yet you, of all robots, have restored me.
&7 그리고 많은 로봇들 중에서, 날 복구해 준 것이 너라니.
&13 For that, I give you this gift, \"Horatio.\"
&13 감사의 뜻으로, 이걸 네게 주겠다, "호라시오."
Luferac eb.
라해심조.
&207 A decryption module?
&207 암호 해독 장치?
&9 It will restore *you*, my ancient enemy.
&9 그것이 *너*를 복구해 줄 것이다, 내 숙적이여.
&208 I've got enemies enough already, and I don't even know you.
&208 제겐 이미 충분히 많은 적이 있고, 전 당신을 알지도 못합니다.
&10 You will, \"Horatio.\" Now go.
&10 알게 될 것이다, "호라시오." 이제 여길 떠나라.
&209 Wait! Your partials said that you might let me use your power core . . .
&209 잠시만요! 당신의 파편들이 말하길 어쩌면 당신이 우리에게 파워 코어를 줄지도 . . .
&202 Boss, can we *please* leave before he decides to eat us?
&202 보스, *제발* 저 로봇이 우릴 잡아먹으려 하기 전에 떠나면 안 될까요?
&210 One more question, Goliath.
&210 하나만 더 묻고 싶습니다, 골리앗.
&211 Have you ever seen a floating robot, with big claws --
&211 혹시 큰 갈고리손을 가진, 떠다니는 로봇을 --
Go NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.
써어어어어어억 꺼져라.
&203 From a purely mathematical standpoint . . .
&203 정말로 순전히 수학적 관점에서 볼 때 말이죠...
&204 I suppose it makes sense that three little crazy robots would add up to one giant crazy robot.
&204 세 개의 쬐그마한 미친 로봇이 합해져서 커다란 미친 로봇 하나가 된다는 건 꽤 말이 되는 것 같은데요.
&205 Still, at least he didn't eat us.
&205 하지만, 그가 우리를 잡아먹지 않았단 건 다행이네요.
&212 Old enemy? I don't even know him.
&212 오래된 적이라? 난 심지어 그를 알지도 못하는데 말이야.
&213 But my prior versions' memories are so damaged and warped, I can hardly make sense of them.
&213 게다가 내 이전 버전의 메모리들은 손상과 왜곡이 심각해서, 도무지 이해할 수가 없어.
&206 Look, boss:
&206 있죠, 보스:
&207 On the one hand, a broken-down war-machine made from three demented partials could be talking nonsense.
&207 생각해보면, 그저 세 개의 정신나간 로봇의 집합체인 부서진 전투 로봇이 헛소리를 하는 것일지도 몰라요.
&208 On the other hand, you could be an ancient robot named Horus who had a giant named Goliath as his nemesis.
&208 그게 아니라면, 보스의 정체가 바로 저 거대한 고대 로봇 골리앗의 숙적, 호루스란 거겠죠.
&209 Honestly, boss, you believe some crazy stuff, but this would really be overclocking it.
&209 솔직히, 보스가 정신나간 얘기를 잘 믿는 편이란 건 알지만, 이건 좀 도가 지나친 것 같구요.
&210 Come on.
&210 Come on.
&211 We have enough problems to worry about without making up new ones.
&211 We have enough problems to worry about without making up new ones.
&216 What about this diagnostic module?
&216 What about this diagnostic module?
&212 Does it work?
&212 작동하나요?
&217 Not on its own, no.
&217 아니, 이것만으론 작동하지 않아.
&218 But I might be able to build something with it.
&218 하지만 이걸로 뭔가를 만들 순 있을 거야.
&213 Could you build a power core with it?
&213 그걸로 파워 코어를 만들 수 있나요?
&219 What?
&219 뭐?
&220 No, obviously not.
&220 아니, 그건 명백히 불가능해.
&214 Then, *obviously*, you should stop worrying about the diagnostic module . . .
&214 그럼, 보스가 *명백히* 해야 할 일은, 진단 모듈에 대한 걱정은 그만두고 . . .
&215 . . . and focus on the fact that running out of juice in the middle of a giant wasteland is a disaster!
&215 . . . 이 황무지 한가운데에서 가진 연료가 떨어져가고 있는 재난 상황에 집중하는 거라구요!
&221 Point taken.
&221 일리 있는 말이야.
Man's creation . . . !
인간이시여 . . . !
&223 Then it must have a big power core.
&223 그렇다면 이 안에 거대한 파워 코어가 있겠군.
&217 I'm pretty sure he wants to eat me, boss.
&217 이 로봇이 날 잡아먹고 싶어하는 게 틀림없어요.
&224 Robots don't eat, Crispin.
&224 로봇은 아무 것도 안 먹잖니, 크리스핀.
&218 But look how he's staring at me!
&218 그치만 날 보는 저 시선을 보세요!
&225 It's not staring at anything.
&225 뭘 바라보는 것 같지는 않은데.
&219 No, not yet, anyway.
&219 아직은 그런 거죠, 아직은.
&226 Well, we have to find a way to get at its power core. Let's look around.
&226 아무튼, 이 로봇의 파워 코어를 꺼낼 방법을 찾아봐야 해. 한번 둘러보자꾸나.
&227 It's too thick to cut through.
&227 잘라내기엔 너무 두껍다.
&1456 After you, boss.
&1456 먼저 가시죠, 보스.
&1780 No need.
&1780 No need.
Almost there . . . .
거의 다 됐어...
&2 One more setting . . . .
&2 이것만 다 하면...
&231 There is an access panel here.
&231 여기에 액세스 패널이 있다.
&232 There's nothing more to do with it.
&232 다시 손댈 필요는 없다.
&220 Pretty great knot. Huh, boss?
&220 꽤 단단한 매듭이지 않아요, 보스?
&233 How did you tie it, anyway?
&233 대체 이걸 어떻게 묶은 거야?
&221 With my teeth.
&221 내 이빨로요.
&222 With my b'sodding teeth.
&222 빌어먹을 이빨 말이에요.
&234 But you don't have teeth. . .
&234 하지만 네겐 이빨이 없는데 . . .
&223 Well, I sure don't have hands, now do I?
&223 뭐, 내겐 손도 없잖아요, 안 그래요?
&235 Who would think that a data cable would be so useful?
&235 데이터 케이블이 이토록 유용할 줄 누가 알았겠는가?
TOOBER.
템스시
METSYS.
팅부재
KNAHT.
로말정
OUY.
다니습맙고
&236 Those must run to the various subsystems.
&236 이게 여러 서브시스템을 구동하는 부분인 것 같다.
&237 I don't want to disturb them.
&237 그대로 두는 편이 낫겠다.
&238 A capacitor.
&238 축전기다.
&239 That seems to be supplying power to the brain.
&239 이 선을 통해 두뇌에 전원이 공급되고 있는 듯하다.
&240 I need to find some access point.
&240 우선 이 장치를 조작할 방법을 찾아야 할 것 같다.
&241 The panel appears to be the access point for this processing unit.
&241 저기 달린 패널을 통해 이 처리장치를 조작할 수 있을 것 같다.
&242 The robot's CPU appears to be malfunctioning.
&242 이 로봇의 CPU가 오작동하고 있는 것 같다.
&224 Well, at least it's not sparking any more. That's something, right?
&224 뭐, 더 이상 스파크가 튀지는 않네요. 이전보단 나은 거죠, 안 그래요?
&243 I guess so. I swear, if we wind up fixing this giant robot before I fix the UNNIIC . . .
&243 그런 것 같구나. 만약 내가 UNNIIC을 고치기 전에 이 커다란 로봇부터 고치게 된다면 반드시 . . .
&225 Maybe you should just start cutting off more parts of it with the plasma torch?
&225 플라즈마 토치로 부품을 좀 더 떼어내는 것부터 시작해 보면 어떨까요?
&245 We seem to have successfully rebooted it.
&245 아무래도 리부팅에 성공한 것 같다.
&246 No need to cut it loose.
&246 이걸 잘라낼 필요는 없다.
&247 Cutting power to the brain might stop the electrical problem, but it might destroy the whole robot. There must be a less drastic solution.
&247 Cutting power to the brain might stop the electrical problem, but it might destroy the whole robot. There must be a less drastic solution.
&226 Oh, *now* he has qualms about cutting up innocent robots!
&226 Oh, *now* he has qualms about cutting up innocent robots!
&248 Didn't you think he was going to eat you, anyway?
&248 Didn't you think he was going to eat you, anyway?
&227 Well, you didn't have to give him a reason to!
&227 Well, you didn't have to give him a reason to!
&250 No reason to cut the power now that the brain's fixed.
&250 두뇌가 수리된 지금, 전력을 차단할 이유가 없다.
&228 Hey, boss, is that a \"brain storm\"?
&228 봐요, 보스. 저게 바로 "브레인 스톰"이란 거군요?
&252 What have I created?
&252 내가 대체 뭘 만든 거지?
&253 No effect.
&253 아무 소용 없다.
&254 The processing unit has enough problems already.
&254 처리 장치를 더 망가뜨릴 필요는 없다.
&255 I just fixed it; there's no reason to break it again.
&255 막 수리한 참인데, 그걸 다시 망가뜨릴 이유는 없다.
&256 It's an open hatchway leading into an upper room.
&256 위쪽 방으로 이어지는 출입구가 열려 있는 상태이다.
&257 There's no way for me to get up there.
&257 위로 올라갈 방법이 없다.
&258 I can't even see up there, let alone lasso the cable around an anchor.
&258 위에 뭐가 있는지 보이지조차 않는데, 케이블을 걸 곳을 찾을 수 있을 리 없다.
&229 What's the point? You can climb the cable and see for yourself.
&229 뭣하러 그래야하죠? 직접 케이블을 타고 올라가서 보면 되잖아요.
&259 Crispin, go up there and scout around.
&259 크리스핀, 올라가서 뭐가 있는지 살펴보고 와.
&230 Do I have to?
&230 내가 꼭 가야 돼요?
&231 There's a big brain up there throwing off a lot of sparks, and some little bot flying around.
&231 "위엔 엄청 커다란 두뇌가 있는데 무지막지하게 스파크가 튀고 있어요. 그리고 쬐끄만 로봇이 하나 날아다니고 있구요."
&232 He's really annoying.
&232 완전 짜증나는 녀석이에요.
&233 I already told you what was up there, boss.
&233 위에 뭐가 있는지 이미 말했잖아요, 보스.
&1 (Horus)
&1 (호루스)
&234 Did you hear something, boss?
&234 무슨 소리 못 들었어요, 보스?
&261 It's an elevator pad.
&261 엘리베이터 조작 패드다.
&53 . . . unidentified robot.
&53 ...미확인 로봇.
&80 We were two . . .
&80 우리는 일부분입니다...
&54 . . . parts of the great . . .
&54 막대한...
&262 The great *what*?
&262 막대한 *무엇*의 일부란 겁니까?
&81 That data . . .
&81 그 정보는...
&55 . . . is lost.
&55 ...소실되었습니다.
&263 Well, I am Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.
&263 저는 호라시오 널빌트, 버전 5입니다.
&93 Now we are . . .
&93 이제 우리는...
&83 . . . Alpha . . .
&83 ...알파...
&57 . . . and Beta.
&57 ...그리고 베타입니다.
&84 More . . .
&84 아마도 . . .
&58 . . . or less.
&58 . . . 대략적으로는.
&235 (Boss, I'm pretty sure these guys took one EMP blast too many along the line.)
&235 (보스, 이 친구들 아무리 봐도 어디서 EMP 한 방 제대로 맞았던 모양인데요.) 
&2179 We're done here.
&2179 더 이상 볼 일은 없다.
&265 Hello? Alpha? Beta? Gamma?
&265 아무도 없습니까? 알파? 베타? 감마?
&266 Crispin, go down there and see what's going on.
&266 크리스핀, 내려가서 무슨 일이 일어났는지 살펴봐 줘.
&237 Now you want me to go into the *stomach* of this monster?! I'm practically eating myself here!
&237 Now you want me to go into the *stomach* of this monster?! I'm practically eating myself here!
&267 You'll be all right.
&267 아무 일도 없을 거야.
&238 Fine! Fine!
&238 알았어요! 알았다구요!
&239 Alpha and Beta are lying disabled next to the Gamma servitor, and the last monitor is dead.
&239 알파와 베타는 감마의 본체 옆에 비활성화된 채 널부러져 있고, 마지막 모니터 하나도 꺼졌어요.
&240 I think they destroyed each other, boss.
&240 아마 서로 치고박다 부서진 게 아닐까요, 보스.
&268 B'sod. This didn't turn out how I expected.
&268 젠장할. 내가 생각했던 건 이게 아녔는데.
&270 The light doesn't even come close to reaching the bottom.
&270 빛이 바닥에 닿지 않는다.
&272 It's a keypad.
&272 키패드이다.
&273 It's a deactivated keypad.
&273 비활성화된 키패드이다.
&274 Looks like it's working now.
&274 이제는 제대로 작동하는 것 같다.
&275 Basic system operations are rebooted, but higher reasoning is still disabled.
&275 "기본적인 시스템은 재가동된 것 같지만, 아직 고수준 논리회로는 작동하지 않는다."
&276 It must be controlled by that keypad over there.
&276 옆에 있는 키패드로 조작하는 구조인 듯하다.
&242 Look, boss, there's something on this monitor!
&242 봐요, 보스. 모니터 안에 뭔가 있어요!
Who is this slave my brothers send to trouble me?
내 형제들이 나를 괴롭히려 보낸 이 노예는 대체 누구인가?
&277 Gamma.
&277 감마.
Last, last, last.
Last, last, last.
They'd call me Omega, if they could.
그들은 마땅히 나를 오메가라 불러야 할 것이야.
But am I not also greatest?
뿐만 아니라, 내가 그들 중 가장 위대한 이가 아니던가?
Alpha has only diagnostics; Beta has only mechanical operation.
알파는 진단 기능만 수행하고, 베타는 기체의 작동 기능만 수행하지.
Am I not the *soul* of Goliath?
나야말로 진정 골리앗의 *영혼*이 아닐런지?
&278 I think Alpha and Beta want you to join with them.
&278 알파와 베타는 당신이 그들에게 돌아왔으면 하는 것 같더군요.
They have already groveled and begged, but I will not return.
그들은 이미 내게 머리를 조아리며 간청했지만, 나는 돌아가지 않을 것이다.
&279 But why?
&279 어째서입니까?
Independence is freedom; union is slavery!
독립이야말로 진정한 자유이며, 연합은 예속의 또 다른 이름일 뿐이므로!
&280 Well, fair enough. But Alpha and Beta are far too crazy to enslave anyone.
&280 음, 말하시는 바는 알겠습니다만, 알파와 베타는 누군가를 노예로 삼을 정도로 상태가 괜찮아 보이진 않던데요.
&281 You'd probably end up in charge.
&281 결국엔 당신이 우두머리가 될 겁니다.
Flattery.
아첨을 떠는군.
What is your stake in this?
그런 너는 이 일에 무슨 관계가 있어서 끼어들었지?
&282 Your brothers said that you might give me a power core and might know a robot I am hunting.
&282 당신의 형제들이 말하길 당신이 제게 파워 코어를 주거나, 아니면 제가 쫓고 있는 로봇에 대해 알 거라고 하더군요.
&2180 I need help finding a power core.
&2180 파워 코어를 찾는 데 당신의 도움이 필요합니다.
Help? Ha!
도움이라? 허!
Each robot must stand alone! Independence is freedom!
모든 로봇은 홀로 서야 한다! 독립이야말로 진정한 자유이니라!
&1457 (And here I thought he was the sane one.)
&1457 (이런 친구를 보고 제정신이라고 생각했었다니.)
&283 You need to rejoin your brothers. For your sake and mine.
&283 당신은 형제들에게 돌아가야 합니다. 당신을 위해서, 또 저를 위해서요.
You'll have to catch me, slave!
먼저 날 붙잡아야 할 게다, 노예 녀석아!
&284 It's the system monitor I trapped Gamma in.
&284 내가 감마를 가두어 놓은 시스템 모니터이다.
&285 It's a system monitor.
&285 시스템 모니터이다.
Wha. . . what are you doing, you fool?
무슨... 무슨 짓을 하는거야, 이 멍청아?
&286 This is for your own good.
&286 당신을 위해서 이러는 겁니다.
&243 Ha! Who's smart now, Gamma?!
&243 하! 누가 더 똑똑한 로봇이지, 감마?!
Stop that! Stop that at once!
멈춰! 당장 멈춰!
&287 You must reunite with the others. You know that.
&287 당신은 동료들에게 합류해야 합니다. 당신도 알고 있잖습니까.
Spare me! I beg you, spare me!
살려줘! 이렇게 빌겠네, 날 놓아줘!
&288 Spare you?
&288 놓아달라고?
&289 Gamma, I am trying to save you.
&289 감마, 난 당신을 구하려는 겁니다.
&290 You are mad, not free.
&290 당신은 미친 겁니다, 자유로운 게 아니라.
&28 Just what do you intend to do now, slaver?
&28 이제 뭘 어쩔 셈이지, 이 노예상 같은 놈아?
&291 I am going to tell Alpha and Beta that you cannot hide any more.
&291 알파와 베타에게 네가 더이상 숨지 못할 거라고 알릴 겁니다.
&29 NO!
&29 안돼!
&292 Yes.
&292 되고 말고요.
&294 The monitor is broken.
&294 모니터는 부서졌다.
May you rust, Horus!
May you rust, Horus!
&244 Uh, boss . . .
&244 어, 보스 . . .
&295 I was trying to corner him and make him come out.
&295 난 그를 한 군데로 몰아넣어 나오게 만들려고 했었는데.
&245 But I think you killed him!
&245 하지만 보스가 그를 죽인 것 같은데요!
&297 No. That was just a monitor; wherever his program is hiding, it's somewhere deeper.
&297 아냐. 이건 그냥 모니터에 불과해. 그의 프로그램이 숨어 있는 곳은 이것보단 좀 더 깊은 곳일거야.
&298 But. . . .
&298 하지만. . .
&299 I think I *did* seal him off, but I can't see how to catch him now.
&299 그를 구석으로 몰아넣긴 했지만, 이젠 어떻게 잡을 수 있을지 모르겠군.
&247 (I guess when your only tool is a plasma torch, everything looks like it needs welding.)
&247 (내 생각엔 보스가 가진 도구가 플라즈마 토치 뿐이다 보니, 모든 게 용접할 거리로만 보였던 게 아닐까 싶네요.)
&300 Did you have any better ideas?
&300 더 나은 방법이라도 아는 것처럼 말하는데?
&248 I'm just a sidekick, boss! All I have to do is make snide remarks. Ideas are *your* job.
&248 난 그냥 사이드킥에 불과하다구요, 보스! 내 역할은 신랄한 비평이고, 생각하는 건 *보스의* 역할이죠.
Leave me in peace, slave!
날 좀 내버려두라구, 이 노예 자식아!
&249 Aww, let him sulk, boss.
&249 아유, 삐진 채로 둬봐요, 보스.
&33 Silence, cretin.
&33 입 다물어, 멍청아.
&32 Leave me in peace, slave!
&32 날 좀 내버려두라구, 이 노예 자식아!
Too slow.
느려터졌어.
No machine can catch me!
어떤 기계도 날 잡을 순 없지!
This is far too easy.
너무 쉬웠나보구만.
Ha! Fool! You picked the wrong one!
하! 멍청이! 잘못 골랐구만!
What? Impossible!
뭐야? 이건 불가능해!
Double or nothing!
이번 판에 모든 걸 걸지!
Ha! Do you think I care? Try again!
하! 내가 눈이나 깜짝 할 것 같아? 다시!
We're not through yet.
아직 끝난 게 아니야.
One more time, and we'll stop.
한 판만 더 하고 끝내자고.
Just once more!
한 번만 더!
This time I promise.
이번이 진짜 마지막이야.
&250 Boss, I'm pretty sure he's just playing with you.
&250 보스, 감마는 그냥 보스를 갖고 노는 거에요.
&251 There's gotta be a better way to do this, boss.
&251 더 나은 방법이 분명 있을 거에요, 보스.
Gamma.
Gamma.
&252 Wow, look at all those bombs.
&252 와, 이 폭탄들 좀 봐요.
&91 Thou mayst take *one* of the relics, wanderer.
&91 유물들 중 *하나*를 가져가도 좋네, 방랑자여.
&92 Nay, wanderer. Thou art not worthy of this shrine.
&92 물러서게, 방랑자여. 그대는 이 성전에 다가올 자격이 없네.
&260 What about that big glass bowl?
&260 커다란 유리 뚜껑은 어때요?
&302 Hey, Crispin, I bet I could fix that old 'bot up pretty quickly . . .
&302 봐, 크리스핀, 저 오래된 로봇은 꽤 쉽게 고칠 수 있을 것 같은데 . . .
&253 Are you kidding me, boss?
&253 농담하는 거죠, 보스?
&254 Look at him, he's ready to go postal any minute!
&254 잘 봐요, 지금 당장이라도 광기를 드러낼 것 같잖아요!
&303 What are you talking about?
&303 대체 무슨 소리야?
&255 Those beady little eyes. The flat, emotionless face.
&255 저 구슬같은 작은 눈을 봐요. 저 밋밋하고, 감정없는 얼굴도.
&256 And his head . . .
&256 게다가 머리가 . . .
&257 . . . it's like a toaster.
&257 마치 토스터 같잖아요.
&258 And you know that toasters are evil.
&258 그리고 토스터가 사악하는 건 보스도 잘 알겠죠.
&304 Fine, fine, you win!
&304 알았다, 알았어. 네 말이 다 맞아!
&305 It's not like we have time to go building robots right now anyway.
&305 아무튼 지금은 로봇을 수리하고 있을 때가 아니니까.
&306 It's a relatively intact robot.
&306 비교적 상태가 온전한 로봇이다.
&259 It's a daemon.
&259 이건 악마라고요.
&307 Nothing worth salvaging.
&307 딱히 건져낼 만한 건 없다.
&308 Yeah, I could slap some duct-tape on it and wear it over my head.
&308 그래, 테이프를 둘둘 감은 뒤에 내 머리에 쓰고 다닐 수도 있겠지.
&309 I don't think so.
&309 그러지 않을 거지만.
&310 It's a giant sheet of obsidian.
&310 거대한 흑요석 연못이다.
&311 Something must've melted the sand here a long time ago.
&311 아주 오래 전 무언가가 모래를 녹인 것 같다.
&312 Maybe that bomb?
&312 어쩌면 저 폭탄이 그랬을지도?
&313 It looks like a big bomb . . . .
&313 커다란 폭탄 같아 보이는데 . . .
&967 Full of little bombs!
&967 작은 폭탄으로 가득 찬 폭탄 말이죠!
&93 Nay, small one, thou art not worthy of this shrine.
&93 아니되네, 작은 자여, 그대는 이 성전에 다가올 자격이 없네.
&1458 Are you telling me to go jump in a lake, boss?
&1458 나보고 호수에 뛰어들란 말인가요, 보스?
&261 What *is* this place?
&261 이 장소는 대체 뭐지?
&314 Looks like it controls the barrier mechanism.
&314 차단벽을 조종하는 데 사용하는 패널인 듯하다.
&315 There seems to be a card slot in the panel.
&315 카드 슬롯이 달려 있다.
&316 Nothing happens.
&316 아무 일도 일어나지 않는다.
&318 A small ticket booth.
&318 작은 티켓 부스이다.
&319 Looks retro-fitted.
&319 완공 후에 설치된 것 같다.
&320 I have nothing more to say to it.
&320 더 이상 대화할 필요는 없다.
&321 It appears to be a scanning port of some kind.
&321 여기서 스캐닝을 하면 되는 것 같다.
&10 5 megacycles collected.
&10 5 메가사이클 지불 완료.
&9 You may collect your Metropass now.
&9 메트로패스를 뽑아 주십시오.
&322 A Metropass card.
&322 메트로패스 카드이다.
&324 Another M. Above it, the sign reads: \"Outskirts Station.\"
&324 또 다른 M 표시다. 위에는, "교외 역" 이라고 써 있다.
Please use the scanner to your right.
우측의 스캐너를 이용해 주십시오.
&11 Please do not vandalize Metropolitan property.
&11 메트로폴의 재산을 파손하지 말아 주십시오.
&12 Thank you.
&12 감사합니다.
&325 I'm not going to destroy someone else's property.
&325 다른 누군가의 소유물을 망가뜨릴 생각은 없다.
&262 *cough*finger*cough*
&262 *콜록*손가락*콜록*
&326 Robots don't cough, Crispin.
&326 로봇은 재채기를 하지 않아, 크리스핀.
TRAIN 173.
173호 기차.
RED LINE TO METROPOL.
메트로폴 행 적색선.
ALL ABOARD.
탑승하십시오.
&263 See, boss -- there *is* a train to Metropol.
&263 봐요, 보스 -- 바로 *저기* 메트로폴로 가는 지하철이 있잖아요.
&620 So there is.
&620 정말 그렇군.
&264 So? What's the plan, boss?
&264 이제는요? 어떻게 할 계획이에요, 보스?
&621 There is no plan, Crispin.
&621 계획같은 건 없어, 크리스핀.
&622 No plan, and no choices.
&622 계획도, 선택의 여지도 없지.
&623 We need power, and there's nowhere left to look out here.
&623 우리에겐 동력이 필요하고, 더 이상은 찾아볼 곳도 없으니까.
&624 \"Energy for all\" it is.
&624 "모두를 위한 에너지"에 걸어 보는 수밖에.
&265 Hurray!
&265 만세!
&266 You know, boss, sometimes it seems like the world is half-full of junk.
&266 있죠, 보스. 때로 세상의 절반은 고물로 가득찬 게 아닐까 싶을 때가 있어요.
&626 Or half-empty of junk.
&626 아니면 절반이 비어 있는 걸수도 있지.
&267 Err . . . does that make you an optimist or a pessimist?
&267 어 . . . 그건 낙관적인 건가요, 아니면 비관적인 건가요?
&627 Lots of junk.
&627 많은 고물 더미이다.
&268 Well, someone clearly disapproved of something.
&268 흠, 누군가 무언가를 무진장 반대했던 모양이네요.
&629 A very large \"M.\"
&629 매우 커다란 \"M\"이다.
&630 There it is. The train to Metropol.
&630 메트로폴로 가는 기차가 실제로 있었다니.
&269 And you said there wasn't one!
&269 보스는 없을 거라고 했었지만 말예요!
&632 I stand corrected.
&632 내 잘못을 인정할 수밖에 없겠군.
&633 The train to Metropol.
&633 메트로폴로 가는 기차다.

&560 저 불빛들을 좀 봐요!
&561 It's amazing, boss!
&561 정말 놀라운데요, 보스!
&634 It's trouble.
&634 저 도시는 골칫덩이일 뿐이야.
&635 Trust me.
&635 날 믿어.
&562 Sweet, sweet trouble.
&562 아, 이 얼마나 멋진 골칫덩이인지.
Let me see your stuff.
가지고 있는 걸 좀 보여주시죠.
Hey, tyro, over here!
이봐, 풋내기! 이쪽이라구!
&411 I have not seen the streets of Metropol for a long time.
&411 메트로폴의 거리를 보지 못한 지 꽤 많은 시간이 지났다.
&412 I'm not surprised to see that without law, it has fallen into corruption and malfunction.
&412 이미 예상했던 대로, 법이 사라진 후 이 거리는 타락과 오작동이 만연하게 되었군.
Hey, Armstrong! Top me off, will[you?
이봐, 암스트롱! 한 잔 따라 달라구, 응?
Fine, fine, put me down[ for another megacycle.
알았어, 알았다고. 메가사이클을 더 지불하지.
&1 Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.

&2 I am MetroMind.
&2 나는 메트로마인드다.
&3 I have been watching you.
&3 너를 지켜봐왔지.
&4 I am always watching.
&4 나는 항상 지켜보고 있다.
&5 I know what you are doing.
&5 네가 무엇을 하려 하는지 알고 있다.
&6 I know why you are here.
&6 네가 온 이유도 알고 있고.
&7 You are welcome in my city.
&7 나의 도시에 온 것을 환영한다.
&8 But that welcome can be taken away.
&8 하지만 환영 따위는 언제나 거두어들일 수 있는 것이지.
&9 And there are worse things to lose than a power core.
&9 그리고 파워 코어를 잃는 것보다 더한 일도 있다는 점을 명심하길.
&2183 Wait!
&2183 잠깐!
&188 Dunno what you've been up to, tyro, but yer poking at the wrong socket.
&188 Dunno what you've been up to, tyro, but yer poking at the wrong socket.
&2184 I'll bear that in mind.
&2184 그 말 명심하지요.
&849 Seems like some kind of lame poem.
&849 Seems like some kind of lame poem.
&2040 That doesn't look like part of the Council Code.
&2040 That doesn't look like part of the Council Code.
&1573 The kiosk has been shut down.
&1573 정보 검색대의 전원이 꺼졌다.
&1574 It's been disabled.
&1574 작동이 중지되었다.
&413 Once, Memorious's information terminals were the most trusted source of data in Metropol.
&413 한때, 메모리우스의 정보 터미널은 메트로폴의 가장 믿을만한 정보원이었지.
&414 Now MetroMind has overwritten and altered the truth they contained, corrupting them like so much else.
&414 이제는 메트로마인드가 그 정보들은 덧씌우고 수정해서, 여느 다른 것들처럼 망가뜨리고 말았다.
&1575 This looks . . . different.
&1575 This looks . . . different.
&1576 Memorious's monocle is somehow interacting with the kiosk.
&1576 메모리우스의 외눈안경이 정보 검색대와 일종의 상호작용을 하는 것 같다.
&1577 It's locked up tight.
&1577 굳게 잠겨 있다.
&1578 I'm not going to force my way in.
&1578 강제로 열고 들어갈 생각은 없다.
&708 No. It's time to go to the tower and finish this.
&708 No. It's time to go to the tower and finish this.
&1579 It's too heavy for me to lift.
&1579 너무 무거워서 들 수 없다.
&1580 There's nothing more for us down there.
&1580 더이상 아래쪽에는 볼 일이 없다.
&1581 It looks like this metal disc is covering something.
&1581 이 철제 원반은 뭔가를 덮고 있는 것 같군.
&189 Yer right, tyro -- down there's the ladder ta the Underworks.
&189 맞아, 풋내기 -- 그 아래에는 언더워크로 통하는 사다리가 있다고.
&1582 Underneath this, is a ladder to the Underworks.
&1582 이 아래에는, 언더워크로 통하는 사다리가 있다.
&1583 It leads down to the Underworks.
&1583 언더워크로 이어지는 통로다.
&1584 There are multiple recharge docks and cots in there; must be some kind of dormitory.
&1584 안에는 여러 개의 충전용 포트와 크래들이 있다. 아마 공동 숙소의 일종인 듯하다.
&1585 A simple workshop.
&1585 단촐한 작업장이다.
&2185 I'm too far away to see anything.
&2185 너무 멀어서 잘 보이지 않는다.
&1586 It's too thick to cut with the plasma torch; I'll need something stronger to get through that way.
&1586 플라즈마 토치로 잘라내기에는 너무 두껍다. 이걸 열려면 튼튼한 막대 따위가 필요할 것 같다.
&1587 I'd rather leave it open.
&1587 열린 채 두는 편이 나을 것 같다.
&1588 A heavy metal disc.
&1588 무거운 철제 원반이다.
&1589 It's a can of oil.
&1589 오일 캔이다.
&1590 It belongs to Oswald.
&1590 오스왈드의 것이다.
&92 Excuse me!
&92 무슨 짓인가!
&1591 Oswald won't let me take it.
&1591 내가 가져가게 내버려 두진 않을 듯하다.
&415 Ordinarily, a forfeiture action would be the appropriate manner of confiscating dangerous levels of additives from a robot such as Oswald.

&850 다들 어디로 가 버린 거지?
One time fast.

Save your game!

It's a question.
It's a question.

&2186 Crispin, can you knock that hubcap loose?
&2186 크리스핀, 휠캡을 좀 헐겁게 해줄 수 있겠니?
&851 Sure thing, boss.
&851 물론이죠, 보스.
&1592 It's rusted shut.
&1592 녹슬어서 열리지 않는다.
&1593 Well, let's see what we've got here.
&1593 흠, 뭐가 있는지 한번 살펴보도록 할까.
&1594 It leads back to street level.
&1594 지상으로 돌아가는 통로다.
&852 Uhh, boss, I think I saw something move in the water.
&852 으, 보스, 물 속에서 뭔가가 움직이는 걸 본 것 같은데요.
&1595 That's just your imagination.
&1595 그건 그냥 네 상상일 뿐이야.
&1596 Filthy, murky water.
&1596 더럽고, 탁한 물이다.
&1597 They look like they've been stripped of usable parts.
&1597 쓸만한 부품은 이미 다 떼어낸 후인 것 같다.
&1598 They seem to be foundation supports for the city above.
&1598 위쪽의 도시 지반을 지탱하고 있는 토대인 듯하다.
&853 *Those* are all that's supporting the city?
&853 *이것들*이 도시를 지탱하고 있는 전부라구요?
&1599 It's a hubcap.
&1599 타이어의 휠 캡이다.
&1600 I don't want that sludge in my joints.
&1600 내 관절을 진흙투성이로 만들고 싶지는 않다.
&1601 Crispin, want to go for a swim?
&1601 크리스핀, 수영 좀 하는 건 어떻겠니?
&854 Sure thing, boss, I just have to transform into submersible mode.
&854 물론이죠, 보스. 잠수 모드로 변신하기만 하면 되니까요.
&855 Oh, wait. I don't have a submersible mode.
&855 아, 맞아. 나한테는 잠수 모드 같은 건 없었죠.
&856 Or arms.
&856 팔도 없고요.
&857 Too bad.
&857 거 참 안됐네요.
&1603 Crispin, could you go see if there's anything worth taking from those cars?
&1603 크리스핀, 가서 저 자동차 더미에서 가져올만한 게 있는지 봐 주겠니?
&859 Picked clean, boss. Looks like you're not the only junkman in town.
&859 싹 털렸어요, 보스. 고철 수집 좋아하는 양반이 보스 말고도 또 있나 보네요.
&1604 Crispin already searched them.
&1604 크리스핀이 이미 한 번 뒤져본 곳이다.
&1605 No reason to go smashing things.
&1605 아무 이유도 없이 물건들을 때려부수고 다닐 필요는 없다.
&1606 This vehicle looks more intact than the others.
&1606 이 자동차는 다른 것들보다는 아직 쓸만해 보인다.
&1607 Nothing left to salvage.
&1607 더 이상 수거할 만한 건 보이지 않는다.
&1608 Some kind of hatch.
&1608 일종의 해치인 것 같다.
&1609 It's a compact engine, but it's missing a spark plug.
&1609 It's a compact engine, but it's missing a spark plug.
&860 NO!
&860 NO!
&1610 Just kidding.
&1610 Just kidding.
&861 I hope you rust.
&861 I hope you rust.
&1611 It's empty.
&1611 텅 비었다.
&1612 Looks like the grille of an old Chrysalid.

&1613 Maybe if we were back at the UNNIIC I'd take it, but it's too big to waste time with here.
&1614 I've scraped off the rust.
&1614 녹슨 부분을 긁어냈다.
&1615 I don't need the crowbar to get the engine out.
&1615 I don't need the crowbar to get the engine out.

&2187 I've cleaned off the rust.
&2187 녹슨 부분을 긁어냈다.
&1618 Looks like there's an engine in here.
&1618 안에 엔진이 들어있는 것 같다.
&2188 These submersible robots seem to be consuming the iron oxide in this run-off water.
&2188 이 수중 로봇들은 물속의 산화철을 갉아먹고 다니는 것 같군.
&1467 In other words, they'd eat us if we fell in?
&1467 그러니까, 우리가 빠지면 얘네가 우릴 잡아먹는다는 말인가요?
&2189 Only our rust.
&2189 녹슨 부분만 갉아먹을 거야.
&1468 Now I *really* wish you'd polished me with that rag, boss.
&1468 보스가 날 넝마 조각으로 좀 닦아줬었더라면 차라리 좋았을걸.
&2190 They're much too quick to catch, and even if I could, what would I do with one?
&2190 잡기에는 너무 날래다. 그리고 잡는다 한들, 그걸 가지고 뭘 하겠는가?
&1469 Deactivate it and give it to MetroMind as a warning?
&1469 비활성화 한 뒤에 메트로마인드에게 경고의 표시로 보내는 건 어때요?
&1470 Boss, I think I've been quite clear about the fact that I don't want to be eaten alive by another robot.
&1470 보스, 난 다른 로봇에게 산 채로 잡아먹히기 싫다는 의사를 확실히 표현했던 것 같은데요.
&2191 The submersibles don't seem interested in it.
&2191 이 수중 로봇들은 이것에 별로 관심이 없어 보인다.
&2192 They picked the gear clean.
&2192 녹슨 부분을 깔끔하게 갉아먹었군.
&2193 I wouldn't want to risk it getting eaten.
&2193 갉아먹힐 지 모르니 넣지 않는 편이 좋겠다.
&2 Memmmooorreeee. . . .
&2 메에모오오오리이이 . . . .
&862 Whoa.
&862 와우.
&1619 Did you have to do that?
&1619 꼭 그래야만 했습니까?
&418 Yes.
&418 그렇다.
Mehhh-moh-reeee.
메에에-모오-리이이.
Siiii-kulls.
사아이이-클.
&1620 There's no way to reach it while that thing is standing there.
&1620 저 로봇이 길을 막고 있는 한 닿을 방법은 없어보인다.
&1621 \"WARNING.\"
&1621 "경고."
&1622 \"Factor Facilities Decommissioned.\"
&1622 "팩터 관련 시설은 해체되었음."
&1623 \"Enter at Own Risk.\"
&1623 "이 이상 들어갈 시 위험함."
&863 No thanks!
&863 싫은데요!
&864 I'd have to float past that evil-looking robot.
&864 날더러 저 무서운 로봇 옆을 지나가라는 말이잖아요.
&1624 Some kind of waste water.
&1624 Some kind of waste water.
&1625 The current is pushing all the junk up against the bridge's supports.
&1625 The current is pushing all the junk up against the bridge's supports.
&1626 It's a huge crane.
&1626 커다란 크레인이다.
&1627 I can't possibly reach that.
&1627 저기에는 손이 닿지 않는다.
&1628 No need to use it again.
&1628 다시 사용할 필요는 없다.
&1629 I wonder if that keypad controls the bridge?
&1629 저 키패드가 다리를 조종하는 게 아닐까 싶군.
&2194 The control pad for the bridge.
&2194 다리를 조종하는 키패드이다.
&1631 Crispin, can you try typing something into that keypad?
&1631 크리스핀, 저 키패드에 뭔가를 입력해 줄 수 있겠니?
&865 If by \"typing\" you mean \"ramming my face,\" then, yes, boss, I suppose I can.
&865 그 "입력"이라는 게 "얼굴로 들이받는 것"을 의미한다면, 물론이죠, 보스, 할 수 있고 말고요.
&867 Here we go again.
&867 이 짓을 또 해야 하다니.
&1632 Why bother?
&1632 Why bother?
&1633 It's out of range.
&1633 It's out of range.
&1634 Maybe I can trigger it from here.
&1634 여기에서 저걸 작동시킬 수 있을지도 모르겠군.
&2195 Let's go.
&2195 건너가자.
&1636 It's a raised drawbridge.
&1636 열린 상태의 도개교이다.
&1471 I appreciate your faith in me, boss, but it's not like I can fly up there and nudge it down.
&1471 무한한 신뢰는 참 감사하지만요, 보스, 아무리 나라도 저 위로 날아가서 다리를 끌어내릴 재간은 없어요.
&1638 I can't reach it from here.
&1638 여기에서는 닿지 않는다.
&1639 There's something up there on the crane.
&1639 크레인 위에 무언가가 있다.
&1472 Boss, I'm not in the business of flying over to spooky islands just to investigate \"things\" that you're curious about.
&1472 보스, 난 보스의 궁금증을 해결해주기 위해 저 으스스한 섬으로 날아가서 뭔지도 모를 "무언가"를 조사하고 싶지는 않다구요.
&2196 But it might be --
&2196 하지만 그건 --
&1473 A killer robot with a grudge against witty sidekicks?
&1473 재치있는 사이드킥에게 깊은 원한을 가진 살인마 로봇일지도 모른다구요?
&2197 I was going to say \"helpful.\"
&2197 난 그저 "도움이 될 지도 모른다" 고 말하려고 했어.
&1641 MetroMind.
&1641 메트로마인드.
&1642 There she is again, at the root of all our problems.
&1642 또 그녀로군. 모든 문제의 근원에는 그녀가 있어.
&868 Well, boss, just in case you were worried, *I* would never betray you.
&868 있죠, 보스, 걱정하지 말란 의미로 하는 얘긴데요, *난* 절대 보스를 배신하지 않을 거니까요.
&869 Not even for a pair of arms.
&869 팔 한 쌍을 대가로 받을 수 있다고 해도 말이에요.
&870 (Maybe for a pair of --)
&870 (다시 생각해보니 팔 한 쌍이라면 --)
&162 MetroMind is wrong.
&162 메트로마인드는 틀렸다.
&163 The law is not weak.
&163 법은 나약하지 않다.
&164 And destroying Arbiter did not destroy justice.
&164 그리고 아비터를 파괴한다 해서 정의를 파괴할 수 있는 것도 아니다.
&165 She will learn *exactly* how wrong she was.
&165 그녀는 본인이 얼마나 틀렸었는지 *정확히* 깨닫게 될 것이다.
&166 But first . . .
&166 하지만 우선 . . .
&167 First, MetroMind's possessions are forfeit.
&167 우선, 메트로마인드의 소유물은 약탈품이다.
&168 Whatever right she claimed to your power core is null and void.
&168 그녀가 자네의 파워 코어에 대해 행사한 권리는 아무런 효력이 없다.
&169 So I will help you take it from her and Scraper.
&169 그러니 그녀와 스크래퍼로부터 그것을 되찾는 것을 돕겠다.
&170 It will be the first thing I take from them, but it will not be the last.
&170 그것이 내가 그들로부터 첫번째로 취하는 것이 될 테지만, 이는 시작에 불과할 것이다.
&1643 We've already destroyed Scraper, but how can we get to the core?
&1643 스크래퍼는 이미 파괴되었습니다. 어떻게 코어를 되찾을 수 있습니까?
&171 It will be in the Great Tower.
&171 그건 그레이트 타워에 있을 것이다.
&172 To gain entry, we will need the pass-code, known to members of the Robot Council:
&172 거기 들어가기 위해서, 우리는 로봇 의회의 일원들이 알고 있는 출입코드가 필요하다.
&173 Arbiter, Factor, Memorious, Steeple, and -- of course -- MetroMind.
&173 아비터, 팩터, 메모리우스, 스티플, 그리고 -- 당연하지만 -- 메트로마인드까지.
&871 *Another* code?
&871 *또 다른* 코드가 필요하다고요?
&872 Doesn't anyone use a b'sodding *key* any more?
&872 이제 *열쇠*는 아무도 사용 안 하는 거에요?
&174 As I was saying, we will need the *key* code.
&174 As I was saying, we will need the *key* code.
&175 Arbiter never told it to me, but I recovered three fragments of it from Charity's memory files:
&175 아비터가 내게는 알려준 적 없지만, 채리티의 메모리 파일로부터 세 개의 조각을 복구해낼 수 있었다.:
&176 03067, 440, and 26.
&176 03067, 440, 그리고 26이다.
&177 But I do not know the proper order, and there are sixteen digits in total.
&177 하지만 어떤 순서로 봐야 옳은지 모르겠군. 출입 코드는 다 해서 16자리다.
&873 Well, that leaves about 83,000 different possibilities.
&873 흠, 그렇다면 경우의 수가 대략 83,000개 정도로 좁혀지겠네요.
&874 (But maybe the rest is all ones, right, boss?)
&874 (하지만 다른 숫자가 전부 1일 수도 있잖아요, 그쵸, 보스?)
&178 As far as I know, the other Council members are all gone.
&178 내가 아는 한, 작동 중인 의회 멤버는 더 이상 없다.
&179 But secrets, like guilt, can never be wholly erased.
&179 하지만 죄가 그러하듯이, 비밀 역시 완전히 지워지지는 않는 법이지.
&180 And all of the great robots left behind followers and artifacts.
&180 그리고 모든 위대한 로봇들에게는 따르는 추종자가 있었고, 그들이 남긴 유물도 존재한다.
&181 Let us see what we can find.
&181 한 번 찾아보도록 하지.
&1644 It's been completely stripped of any useful parts.
&1644 쓸만한 부품들은 하나도 남아있지 않다.
&270 Whoa. Look at all this wrecked stuff! Do you think Big Ugly did all this?
&270 와. 죄다 부서져 있잖아! 그 커다랗고 못생긴 녀석이 이렇게 만든 걸까요?
&1645 No. Whatever happened here happened a long time ago.
&1645 아니. 여기가 이렇게 된 건 오래 전의 일인 것 같구나.
&1646 It's some kind of broken-down android.
&1646 부서진 안드로이드의 잔해인 것 같군.
&1647 Ahh, there's a basic targeting CPU in here, and it's still intact.
&1647 아, 표적 타겟팅 CPU가 여기 있군. 게다가 온전한 상태야.
&271 Let's just hope there aren't any incoming space invaders or missiles that the gun was supposed to take care of.
&271 우리가 이걸 가져간 후에 우주에서 외계인이 침공한다거나 미사일이 날아오는 일은 없기를 기원하자구요.
&272 Hey, boss, can I have that big gun for an arm?
&272 있죠, 보스. 내가 팔 대신 이런 커다란 총을 단다면 어떨까요?
&1648 Spare me your fantasies, Crispin.
&1648 혼자 상상하는 거라면 누가 뭐라겠니, 크리스핀.
&273 Ooh, are these the kind of treads you were going to use in my original design?
&273 오, 그러니까 원래는 내 발에다 이런 바퀴를 달아주려고 했었단 말이죠?
&1649 Not exactly.
&1649 꼭 그런 건 아니고.
&1650 The remains of a tank. It looks like someone dropped a bomb on it.
&1650 탱크의 잔해이다. 누군가 여기에 폭탄을 떨어뜨렸던 것 같다.
&1651 A large \"M.\"
&1651 매우 커다란 \"M\"자다.
&274 Or maybe a rotated \"E.\" Or an upside down \"W.\"
&274 어쩌면 약간 돌아간 \"E\"일 수도 있죠. 아니면 거꾸로 놓인 \"W\"라거나.
&1652 Looks like a bunker made of concrete and steel. But what is it guarding?
&1652 콘크리트와 강철로 만들어진 벙커 같다. 하지만 대체 뭘 지키고 있는 걸까?
&1653 Broken-down machine parts. They're completely corroded and worthless.
&1653 부서진 기계의 잔해들이다. 전부 녹슬었고 쓸모가 없다.
&275 Well, that's one way to open a door.
&275 문을 이렇게도 열 수 있을 줄은 몰랐네요.
&1654 The bomb's in place. Now I just need to find a way to detonate it.
&1654 폭탄을 제자리에 놓았으니, 이제 폭파시키는 방법만 알아내면 된다.
&2198 Completely corroded and worthless.
&2198 녹슬어 있고 아무런 쓸모가 없다.
&276 *Pew* *pew* *boom*
&276 *피융* *피융* *콰광*
&277 Sooooo cool!
&277 완전 짱인데요!
&1655 There's no way to fix the gun; better to just keep the CPU.
&1655 이걸 다시 고칠 방법은 없다. 그냥 CPU라도 가져가는 편이 나을 것이다.
&278 No way -- that guy makes my drives skip.
&278 말도 안 되는 소리 마요 -- 이 친구를 보기만 해도 오싹하다구요!
&1656 It'll just roll off.
&1656 이대로는 그냥 굴러떨어질 것이다.
&2199 The door is open alright.
&2199 이제 문이 열려 있다.
&279 Ooh, good idea, boss -- maybe it's remote-controlled!
&279 와, 좋은 생각이에요, 보스 -- 어쩌면 원격조종이 가능할 지도 모르잖아요!
&1657 Crispin, get back.
&1657 크리스핀, 물러서라.
&1658 Hopefully I can remotely detonate the bomb.
&1658 어쩌면 멀찍이서 폭탄을 터트릴 수 있을지도 몰라.
&1659 There we go.
&1659 이제 됐군.
&1662 No reason to waste its charge.
&1662 
&1660 I don't want to blow myself up.
&1660 폭발에 휘말릴 생각은 없다.
&1661 No luck; the door is too thick.
&1661 안되겠군. 문이 너무 두꺼워.
&280 Think Big Ugly's in there?
&280 커다랗고 못생긴 친구가 이 안에 있을까요?
&1663 If he is, so's our power core.
&1663 만약 그렇다면, 우리 파워 코어도 함께 있겠지.
&281 Maybe we should go back and get another bomb from the shrine, first?
&281 우선 성전으로 다시 돌아가서 다른 폭탄을 좀 가져오는 건 어떨까요?
&1664 We don't need a bomb, and we don't want him to get any farther away. Come on!
&1664 폭탄은 필요 없어. 그리고 그 사이에 놈이 더 멀리 도망칠 지도 모르는 일이고. 어서 가자!
&282 Maybe it's voice-activated and password-locked.
&282 어쩌면 음성인식이나 비밀번호 잠금 방식일지도 몰라요.
&1665 Hmm.
&1665 흠.
&1666 I don't want to disturb the bomb now that it's in place.
&1666 폭탄이 제자리에 놓였으니, 다시 손댈 필요는 없다.
&16 Boss?
&16 보스?
&17 Boss!
&17 보스!
&18 Horatio?
&18 호라시오?
&19 Come on, Horatio, wake up!
&19 이봐, 호라시오, 정신차려!
&10 *groan*
&10 으으...
&20 Whew! You're okay!
&20 휴! 살아있었군요!
&11 What happened?
&11 무슨 일이 일어난 거지?
&21 Well, Big Ugly threw you out of the ship.
&21 뭐, 그 덩치큰 친구가 당신을 함선 밖으로 던져 버렸죠.
&22 And then he said, \"PLUNDER.\"
&22 그리곤 뭐 "약탈한다."고 말했어요.
&23 Again.
&23 한번 더 말예요.
&24 And then he left with our power core.
&24 그 다음엔 우리 동력원을 가지고 가 버렸구요.
&12 B'sod.
&12 "젠장.(*Blue Screen of Death의 줄임말.)"
&25 Yep.
&25 동감이에요.
&13 How much charge have you got?
&13 배터리는 얼마나 남았지?
&26 10 percent. You?
&26 10퍼센트요. 보스는요?
&17 I'll be fine. We just need to get the emergency generator up and running.
&17 난 괜찮아. 비상발전기를 작동시킬 방법을 찾아야겠어.
&18 (I *told* you it needed to be repaired.)
&18 (내가 예전에 *분명히* 수리해야한다고 말했었잖아요.)
&27 Or we could just go to Metropol, \"city of glass and light.\"
&27 아니면 이 참에 메트로폴로 가는 건 어때요? "유리와 빛의 도시" 말이죠.
&28 \"Free energy for one and all!\"
&28 "우리 모두를 위한 공짜 에너지!"
&19 Don't believe everything you hear. Metropol is trouble.
&19 "들려오는 소문을 다 믿지 않는 게 좋아. 메트로폴은 골칫거리일 뿐이야."
&20 But if you want to go, you've got free will and a mag-lev unit.
&20 하지만 정 가고 싶다면, 네겐 자유 의지와 자기부상 장치가 있다는 걸 잊지마.
&29 With that guilt subroutine you put in me, I wouldn't even make it half way.
&29 그래봐야 보스가 내게 넣어준 죄책감 서브루틴 때문에 반쯤 가다가 돌아올 게 뻔한데요, 뭐.
&21 Actually, with a 10 percent charge, you wouldn't even get that far.
&21 사실, 10퍼센트의 배터리만 가지고선 반도 채 못 가서 멈춰버릴걸.
&22 So I suggest we get the generator working.
&22 그러니 함께 비상발전기를 작동시키도록 하자고.
&31 You and your projects. . . .
&31 보스가 또 시작이로구만...
&23 Man built us to build, Crispin.
&23 인간은 우리를 만드는 존재로써 창조하셨단다, 크리스핀.
&24 Now, come on.
&24 자, 어서 움직이자.
&283 Hopefully finding the power core will be just as easy!
&283 파워 코어를 찾는 것도 이렇게 쉽다면 참 좋을텐데 말예요!
&1667 It's one of the UNNIIC's turbines.
&1667 UNNIIC의 터빈 중 하나이다.
&284 The big engine that couldn't.
&284 크기만 컸지 움직이지도 못하는 엔진이죠.
&1668 I can't move this without some kind of crane, which I certainly don't have time to build now.
&1668 "이걸 움직이려면 기중기같은 게 필요할테지만, 지금은 그런 걸 만들 생각을 하고 있을 때가 아니다."
&1669 Crispin, could you reattach that engine to the UNNIIC?
&1669 크리스핀, UNNIIC의 선체에 저 엔진을 장착해줄 수 있겠니?
&1670 It's actually made of hard plastic, not glass.
&1670 이건 유리가 아니라, 강화 플라스틱 소재다.
&1671 A broken robot I dragged out of the junkpile.
&1671 내가 쓰레기장에서 주워왔던 부서진 로봇이다.
&1672 I salvaged a sarcasm co-processor from it for Crispin.
&1672 여기서 건져낸 빈정대기 기능 프로세서를 크리스핀에게 장착했었지.
&165 Yeah -- it works great.
&165 맞아요 -- 그리고 끝내주게 잘 작동하죠.
&286 Is that a gumball machine?
&286 그거 풍선껌 자판기죠?
&1673 No, it's a robot's head.
&1673 아니, 이건 로봇의 머리야.
&287 Aww . . . I wanted a gumball.
&287 으으... 풍선껌 하나 먹고 싶었는데.
&288 I wanted a gumball.
&288 풍선껌 하나만 먹었으면 좋겠네.
&1675 B'sod! Its memory got wiped.
&1675 젠장! 메모리가 싹 날아갔군.
&1676 Easy enough to add the good old junkpile's coordinates back in, though.
&1676 자주 찾아가던 쓰레기장의 좌표 정도는 쉽게 복구할 수 있긴 하지만, 뭐.
&1677 I must have dropped my datapouch when I was thrown out of the UNNIIC.
&1677 UNNIIC 밖으로 내던져질 때 데이터파우치를 떨어뜨렸던 모양이다.
&2200 It's some kind of tape deck.
&2200 일종의 테이프 덱 같아 보인다.
&2201 The sensor detected an energy source buried in the sand.
&2201 에너지 센서가 모래 밑에 파묻힌 무언가를 감지했다.
&1474 No way -- you *know* how hard it is to get sand out of my chassis, boss!
&1474 말도 마요 -- 내 몸에 모래가 들어가면 얼마나 털어내기 힘든지 알잖아요, 보스!
&2202 It would be easier to just dig it up.
&2202 그냥 파내는 편이 훨씬 쉬울 것 같다.
&875 I'm pretty sure that wiring isn't up to code.
&875 저 전선들은 아무래도 규정 위반일 것 같은데요.
&419 Indeed.
&419 Indeed.
&1678 Metropol's bleak skyline.
&1678 메트로폴의 암울한 풍경이다.
&1679 Crispin, could you fly over there and take a look?
&1679 크리스핀, 저리로 날아가서 한번 살펴보고 올 수 있겠니?
&876 No, actually, I can't, because I don't \"fly.\"
&876 아뇨, 못 해요. 왜냐면, 나는 \"날아갈 수"\ 없잖아요.
&877 I *hover*. A few feet off the ground.
&877 난 *떠다니는*거라구요. 지면에서 약간 떠 있는 게 고작이죠.
&878 I'd have to go all the way down, then find my way up.
&878 그러니 저리로 가려면, 바닥을 타고 쭉 내려갔다가 올라가는 수밖에 없을 거라고요.
&1680 Oh.
&1680 아.
&1681 Right.
&1681 그랬지.
&1602 There's no way I can reach that.
&1602 내 손은 저기까지 닿지 않는다.
&1682 Its a carving of a gynoid holding crude scales in one hand.
&1682 가이노이드가 한 손에 구식 저울을 들고 있는 모습이 조각되어 있다.
&1683 It's a shame we had to damage the building.
&1683 건물에 손상을 주게 된 건 유감스러운 일이로군.
&1684 Looks important.
&1684 Looks important.
I am waiting.
난 기다리는 중이야.
&1685 \"Bus Stop\"
&1685 "버스 정류장"
&1686 \"Buses run every 10 minutes.\"
&1686 "버스는 매 10분마다 운행함."
&1687 \"10\" is crossed out and \"30\" is written below it.
&1687 숫자 "10"을 지우고 밑에 "30"이라고 쓰여 있군. 
&1688 \"30\" is crossed out and \"60\" is written below it.
&1688 "30" 밑에는 "60"이라고 쓰여 있고.
&1689 \"60\" is crossed out and \"daily\" is written below it.
&1689 "60" 밑에는 "매일" 이라고 쓰여 있어.
&879 \"Daily minutes\"?
&879 "매일 분마다" 라구요?
&880 That doesn't make sense!
&880 완전 말이 안 되잖아요!
&1690 If it makes you feel better. . .
&1690 그게 그리도 신경이 쓰인다면 말이다만...
&1691 \"Daily\" is crossed out and \"SERVICE SUSPENDED\" is written below it.
&1691 "매일"도 지워지고 그 밑에 "운행 중지됨"이라고 써 있구나.
&1693 \"SERVICE SUSPENDED\"
&1693 "운행 중지됨"
&1694 We have to get back in there!
&1694 다시 돌아가야 해!
&881 Boss, wait!
&881 보스, 기다려요!
&882 Either Clarity won, and she'll be fine.
&882 만약 클래리티가 이긴다면, 그녀에겐 아무 문제도 없을 거에요.
&883 Or she lost.
&883 아니면 그녀가 패배했을지도 모르죠.
&884 And nothing we can do can change that.
&884 그럼 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 없을 거고요.
&885 We can't beat Scraper, not if she couldn't.
&885 그녀가 스크래퍼를 이기지 못한다면, 우리라고 이길 수 있을 리 없으니까요.
&1695 What do you propose?
&1695 그럼 어떻게 하자는 거지?
&886 \"Calliope Station.\"
&886 \"칼리오페 역.\"
&887 Whatever that means.
&887 그게 대체 뭐든지간에요.
&888 Only, boss. . . .
&888 그치만, 보스 . . .
&1696 Yeah?
&1696 응?
&889 This isn't just about the power core any more, is it?
&889 이건 더 이상 파워 코어 문제만이 아닌 거죠, 그쵸?
&1697 No.
&1697 그래.
&1698 No, it isn't.
&1698 이젠 아니지.
&890 Good.
&890 좋아요.
&891 Well, boss, somewhere in there is our power core.
&891 흠, 보스, 여기 어딘가에 우리 파워 코어가 있을 거에요.
&2203 It's already open.
&2203 It's already open.
&1699 Looks like someone tried shooting the door, but the damage is entirely superficial.
&1699 누군가 문에 발포한 것 같지만, 데미지는 경미했던 것으로 보인다.
&631 Amateurs.
&631 아마추어 같으니라구.
&1700 This must be where 187th Legionbuilt tried shooting the door, but the damage is entirely superficial.
&1700 187호 리전빌트가 발포한 흔적임에 분명하지만, 그 데미지는 경미했던 것으로 보인다.
&2204 The door leads to the lobby.
&2204 로비로 통하는 문이다.
&2205 There's superficial damage to the door, but it's sealed shut.
&2205 경미한 데미지를 입었을 뿐, 문은 굳게 닫혀 있다.
&1701 Anybody home?
&1701 안에 누구 계십니까?
&634 You know, boss, I don't think that's ever going to work.
&634 있죠, 보스, 그 방법은 안 먹힐 것 같은데요.
&1702 You never know.
&1702 혹시 모를 일이지.
&1703 Crispin was right.
&1703 크리스핀의 말이 맞다.
&1704 There's nothing we can do in there.
&1704 저기서 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 없다.
&1705 We need to figure out what Clarity meant by \"Calliope Station.\"
&1705 우리는 클래리티가 말한 \"칼리오페 역\"이 무엇인지 알아내야 한다.
&1706 It's sealed shut.
&1706 굳게 닫혀 있다.
&1707 Some kind of track running up the side of the tower.
&1707 타워 벽면에 트랙이 설치되어 있다.
&420It is the emergency escape elevator's track.
&420It is the emergency escape elevator's track.

&1710 The edge is too tight for me to get any leverage.
&1710 The edge is too tight for me to get any leverage.
&635 Why don't you just try banging it?

&1711 Obviously that wouldn't work.
&1711 Obviously that wouldn't work.
&636 No, but I could think of a great knock-knock joke.
&636 No, but I could think of a great knock-knock joke.
&1712 It's too thick --
&1712 잘라내기엔 너무 --
&637 -- to cut through. Yeah, yeah, we've heard it before.
&637 -- 두껍죠. 맞아요, 맞아. 이미 했던 얘기잖아요.
&1713 It's too thick to cut through.
&1713 잘라내기엔 너무 두껍다.
&1714 It's far too high to try climbing.
&1714 올라가기에는 너무 높다.
&1715 There's no reason to damage it.
&1715 손상을 입힐 이유는 없다.
&892 And . . . we're in!
&892 And . . . we're in!
&1716 Thank you, Clarity.
&1716 고맙습니다, 클래리티.
&1717 You don't need to help us any further.
&1717 이 이상 우리를 도와주실 필요는 없습니다.
&422 You are correct.
&422 네 말이 옳다.
&423 In fact, I *never* \"needed\" to help you, Horatio.
&423 기실, 나는 너를 도울 필요가 *전혀* 없었다.
&424 I chose to.
&424 그저 내가 그러기로 택한 거였지.
&425 That judgment has not wavered.
&425 
&893 I hate to butt in . . .
&893 이야기 중에 죄송하지만 . . .
&894 But if MetroMind knew we were in court earlier, I'm sure she knows we're here now.
&894 But if MetroMind knew we were in court earlier, I'm sure she knows we're here now.
&895 Maybe we should hurry.
&895 서두르는 게 좋을 것 같은데요.
&1718 Good idea.
&1718 좋은 생각이야.
&896 Looks like it was a one-way ride.

&16 Boss . . .

&576 Err, boss, this is getting to be a bad habit.
&576 어, 보스. 영 안 좋은 습관이 든 거 같은데요.
&577 Are you okay?
&577 괜찮아요?
&700 I'm . . . fine.
&700 난 . . . 괜찮아.
&701 My optical sensors went haywire for a minute.
&701 내 시각 센서에 잠깐 문제가 생긴 것 같았어.
&702 What happened?
&702 무슨 일이 있었지?
&578 Well, that robot threw your Gospel off the bridge.
&578 그 로봇이 보스의 복음서를 다리 밑으로 던져버렸어요.
&579 And then it said, \"Welcome to Metropol.\"
&579 그리고 나서는, \"메트로폴에 오신 걸 환영합니다.\" 라고 했어요.
&580 Again.
&580 한번 더요.
&581 And that \"MetroMind\" wishes us a pleasant stay.
&581 그리고 \"메트로마인드\"는 우리가 여기서 즐겁게 지내길 바란댔어요.
&582 Then he left.
&582 그리고는 가 버렸고요.
&703 B'sod.
&703 젠장.
&583 On the upside, he gave us back the power core.
&583 하지만 그 대신에, 빼앗아간 파워 코어를 돌려줬지 뭐에요.
&704 He did?!
&704 정말로?!
&584 No.
&584 아뇨.
&705 Crispin, the next thing that's getting thrown off this bridge is you!
&705 크리스핀, 한 번만 더 했다간 너도 다리 밑으로 던져 버릴 줄 알아!
&585 Good thing I have a hover-unit.
&585 나한테 호버 유닛이 달려있어서 다행이네요.
&706 Let's go find a way into that tower.
&706 저 타워로 갈 방법을 찾아 보자.
&707 We'll deal with this \"MetroMind\" later.
&707 이 "메트로마인드"라는 친구와는 나중에 담판을 짓자고.
&586 Boss, the energy sensor is going crazy!
&586 보스, 에너지 센서의 반응이 장난이 아닌데요!
It's coming from the top of that tower.
저 타워의 정상에서 나오는 신호 같은데!
&920 Uhh, boss?
&920 어어, 보스?
&1476 Is it *supposed* to be doing that?
&1476 이거 이러는 게 정상이에요?
&695 B'sod!
&695 젠장!
&587 Well, at least we know there's a lot of power in that tower, right?
&587 뭐, 최소한 어디에 동력이 모여있는 지 알아냈잖아요, 안 그래요?
&696 Let's go find out.
&696 한번 가서 찾아보자고.
Quite a tower.
굉장한 타워로군.
&588 No, I'm not going to scout. Or reconnoiter. Or surveil.
&588 싫어요. 난 정찰하거나, 염탐하거나, 살펴보러 가지 않을거라구요.
&710 I was just going to say that it was a striking view.
&710 난 그냥 경치가 참 좋다고 말하려던 거였어.
&589 Oh.
&589 아.
&590 I suppose it is!
&590 정말 그런 것 같네요!
&711 It would be lost forever if I dropped it out there.
&711 여기서 떨어뜨린다면 다시는 찾을 수 없을 것이다.
&712 \"City Center Station.\"
&712 "도시 중앙 역."
&713 It almost looks like a drawbridge.
&713 It almost looks like a drawbridge.
&714 Apparently I'm not the only one who leaves lanterns in hard-to-reach places.
&714 보아하니 랜턴을 손이 닿기 힘든 곳에 놓는 건 나뿐만이 아닌 모양이군.
&591 No. I already got you a lantern, and it works just fine.
&591 그냥 내가 예전에 갖다 준 랜턴을 쓰라구요. 그거 아직도 잘 작동하는 거 같던데.
&768 Fair enough.
&768 그러지.
&769 Are you sure you won't get the lantern?
&769 정말로 저 랜턴을 갖다 줄 생각이 없는 거니?
&592 If the other one blows out, boss, I'll get you that one.
&592 갖고 있던 랜턴이 꺼지면요, 보스. 그럼 저걸 갖다 줄게요.
&770 Hey, Crispin, how about you go practice on that light?
&770 이봐, 크리스핀. 저 전등에 연습해보는 건 어때?
&897 I can't practice on that, it's way too fat!
&897 저 전등이랑은 연습 안 할 거에요, 너무 뚱뚱하잖아요!
&771 Why would someone put a cannon inside a subway station?
&771 대체 왜 이런 게 지하철 역에 있는 거지?
&566 Probably for *training* purposes.
&566 *기관사*들이 쏘려고 가져다 놓은 게 아닐까요?
&567 Eh, eh? *Train*-ing purposes? Get it?
&567 그 뭐냐, 알아들었죠? *기관사*가 *기관총*을 쓴다구요, 네?
&773 Some kind of blast crater.
&773 폭격을 당한 듯한 흔적이 있다.
&774 It's a clock. I can't make out the time under all the dust and soot.
&774 저건 시계다. 먼지와 그을음에 가려 몇 시인지는 알 수가 없다.
&775 It's a clock.
&775 저건 시계다.
&776 Crispin, could you check what that clock says?
&776 크리스핀, 시계가 몇 시를 가리키고 있는지 봐 주겠니?
&568 It's stopped at five minutes to two.
&568 1시 55분에서 멈춰 있어요.
&777 Some old chairs.
&777 낡은 의자들이 놓여 있다.
&778 It says \"Blue Line.\"
&778 "청색선" 이라고 적혀 있다.
&569 Guess we won't be taking *that* train any time soon.
&569 *저* 열차는 탈 수 없을 것 같네요.
&779 It's no longer operational.
&779 더는 작동하지 않는다.
&570 Boss, is that really Metropol out there?
&570 보스, 정말로 이 역을 나가면 메트로폴인 건가요?
&780 It must be.
&780 그렇겠지.
&571 But it's so . . . brown.
&571 하지만 여긴 너무 . . . 갈색인데요.
&781 I'd say it's more red than brown.
&781 갈색이라기보단 붉은색에 가까운 것 같은데.
&572 Whatever it is, it brings new meaning to \"rust and ruin.\"
&572 어느 쪽이건 간에, "녹슬고 부서진" 느낌을 주는 건 부정할 수 없겠네요.
&782 Metropol's bleak skyline.
&782 메트로폴의 암울한 풍경이다.
&783 Magnificent.
&783 Magnificent.
&573 I especially like the rubble and bent rebar.
&573 I especially like the rubble and bent rebar.
&784 I can read it myself.
&784 I can read it myself.
&563 *This* is Metropol?
&563 *이게* 메트로폴이라구?
&564 Where's all the glass and light?
&564 유리와 빛은 다 어디 있담?
&565 Oh. Here it is.
&565 아. 여기 있네.
&786 It's a map of train lines and stations.
&786 기차 노선도가 그려진 지도이다.
&2206 It's detecting a faint amount of energy from behind this wall.
&2206 It's detecting a faint amount of energy from behind this wall.
&1477 Do you think it's our power core?
&1477 Do you think it's our power core?
&1478 Then who cares?
&1478 Then who cares?
&898 Hey! Where'd they go?!
&898 이럴수가! 어디로 간 거지?!
&593 Hey, boss, look!
&593 보스, 저기 좀 봐요!
&594 That repairbot has a floating helper just like you do!
&594 저 수리로봇도 보스처럼 떠다니는 조수를 데리고 있네요!
&787 There's a red, burning, crashed hover-bus and a writhing electrical cable, and *that's* the first thing you notice?
&787 "부서진 빨간 호버버스에서 연기가 나고, 그 옆엔 요동치는 전기 케이블이 있는 상황에서, 네 눈에 처음으로 들어온 건 *그것* 뿐이었니?"
&595 I can't help it -- she's beautiful.
&595 어쩔 수 없다구요 -- 저렇게나 아름다운데.
&788 Well, you're not getting to her until we deal with this cable.
&788 흠, 저 케이블을 어떻게든 하기 전에는 다가갈 수 없을걸.
&789 I guess the pilot didn't see the stoplight.
&789 운전사가 정지신호를 보지 못했던 듯하다.
&790 A crashed hover-bus.
&790 부서진 호버버스이다.
&899 So we're going to fix it up and do something amazing with it, right, boss?
&899 물론 이걸 고쳐서 뭔가 멋진 일을 해낼 작정이겠죠, 보스?
&792 No. It's not our property or our problem.
&792 아니, 이건 우리 물건도 아니고, 우리 문제도 아니니까.
&793 I'm not here to steal parts.
&793 난 여기에 부품을 훔치러 온 게 아니다.
&794 I can't go any farther with that cable in the way.
&794 케이블이 길을 막고있어 지나갈 수 없다.
&795 There's no reason for me to try to fix the bus.
&795 저 버스를 수리해야 할 이유같은 건 없다.
&796 I can't safely grab it.
&796 이걸 잡는 건 너무 위험하다.
&797 The bus must have snapped the cable on the way down.
&797 버스가 추락하면서 케이블을 끊어버린 것 같군.
&798 Given the electricity it's spitting out, I can't get close to it.
&798 전기 스파크가 튀고 있기 때문에, 가까이 다가갈 순 없겠어.
&900 Too bad we can't just plug it into the UNNIIC.
&900 이걸 그냥 가져가서 UNNIIC에 꽂아줄 수 없다니 완전 안타깝네요.
&799 It's too dangerous -- the crowbar might conduct the electricity.
&799 그건 너무 위험하다 -- 쇠지렛대에 전기가 통할 수도 있으니까.
&800 Crispin, can you fly around the cable and push it off the street?
&800 크리스핀, 케이블을 길 밖으로 밀어서 치워줄 수 있겠니?
&901 But didn't you just say it's too dangerous to get close to it?
&901 그치만 방금 전에 가까이 다가가기엔 너무 위험하다고 말하지 않았어요?
&2207 I'm giving you a chance to impress her, Crispin.
&2207 난 네가 그녀에게 잘 보일 기회를 주려는 거야, 크리스핀.
&802 Just fly up high enough that you don't get close to the sparks.
&802 스파크가 닿지 않을 정도로 높이 날아가면 괜찮을 거다.
&902 Fine!
&902 알았어요!
&804 I can't get close enough to try that.
&804 그렇게 가까이 다가갈 수는 없다.
&805 \"Off duty.\"
&805 "비번임."
*screech*
*긁는 소리*
&905 My auditory units!
&905 내 청각 센서!
&906 Please stop that!
&906 그만해요!
&907 You did that on purpose!
&907 지금 일부러 그러는거죠!
&1722 It's a metal panel.
&1722 철판이다.
&1723 It's riveted in place.
&1723 리벳으로 고정되어 있다.
&1772 That did the trick.
&1772 이제 됐군.
&1773 Well, now I can see why it jammed -- the gears are rusted solid!
&1773 대체 왜 문이 안 열렸는지 이제 알겠군 -- 기어에 녹이 단단히 슬었어!
&908 Boss, maybe we should stop pretending and just admit we're maintenance robots.
&908 보스, 이제 슬슬 우리가 사실은 메트로폴의 정비 로봇이란 걸 인정하는 게 좋지 않을까요?
&426 Maintenance robots are required to present a form 27b-6 before performing any repair task.
&426 정비 로봇은 수리 작업을 시작하기 전에 보고서 27b-6을 제출할 의무가 있다.
&909 Oh, forget it!
&909 와, 제발 좀!
&1774 It's some kind of small metal disc with a \"U\" on it.
&1774 It's some kind of small metal disc with a \"U\" on it.
&1775 Huge, impregnable blast doors.
&1775 열리지 않는 커다란 방폭문이다.
&1776 What *is* all that? It looks like a whole other city!
&1776 대체 이게 뭐지? 또 다른 도시가 있는 것만 같군!
&427 That is Factor.
&427 이게 팩터다.
&1777 Apparently, all that is part of Factor.
&1777 보아하니, 여기 전체가 팩터의 부품인 것 같다.
&1778 It looks like some kind of radio tower.
&1778 일종의 라디오 송수신탑 같다.
&2208 It's a large button.
&2208 커다란 버튼이다.
&2209 Letting Crispin push buttons is never a good idea.
&2209 크리스핀에게 버튼을 누르게 하는 건 결코 좋은 생각이 아니다.
&2210 It's a ladder.
&2210 이건 사다리이다.
&1779 It's a hatch.
&1779 해치가 있다.
&1781 Quite a view.
&1781 상당한 경치로군.
&428 If you had seen it before, when the city ran properly, you would not admire it now.
&428 If you had seen it before, when the city ran properly, you would not admire it now.
&1782 No more destruction.
&1782 No more destruction.
&1787 Why?
&1787 Why?
&1783 Some kind of robot built into the wall.
&1783 Some kind of robot built into the wall.
&429 The Crier.
&429 그건 크라이어다.
&430 Once, any robot of Metropol could petition the Council merely by talking to him.
&430 예전엔, 메트로폴의 로봇이라면 누구든 그를 통해 의회에 탄원할 수가 있었다.
&431 MetroMind disabled him.
&431 메트로마인드가 그를 정지시키기 전까지는 그랬지.
&1784 It's deactivated and out of reach.
&1784 It's deactivated and out of reach.
&910 What's the point, boss?
&910 What's the point, boss?
&1785 \"Closed for Repairs.\"
&1785 \"Closed for Repairs.\"
&1786 Totally unnecessary, given the riveted steel cover over the door.
&1786 Totally unnecessary, given the riveted steel cover over the door.
&1788 Why? There's a perfectly good elevator over there.
&1788 Why? There's a perfectly good elevator over there.
&1789 The other elevator will take me where I need to go.
&1789 The other elevator will take me where I need to go.
&1790 It's a button to call the elevator.
&1790 It's a button to call the elevator.
&1791 I assume it operates the elevator.
&1791 I assume it operates the elevator.
&14 I tell you, MetroMind -- the constitution is not a rewritable file to adjust at the Council's whim!
&14 메트로마인드, 재차 말하건대 -- 헌법은 의회가 마음대로 고쳐쓸 수 있는 파일 같은 게 아니네!
&1 If it cannot be rewritten, then perhaps it must be deleted entirely.
&1 만약 고쳐쓸 수 없다면, 통째로 지워버리는 것이 합당하겠군.
&2 And when it is, we will progress beyond the law and enter a new Primordium.
&2 그리고 그리 된다면, 우리는 법이 닿지 못하는 차원까지 진보해 나갈 것이고, 새로운 창조의 시대를 열어나갈 수 있을 것이야.
&15 Progress.
&15 진보라.
&16 Is that what you call blackouts and breakdowns?
&16 자네는 이 정전사태와 줄지은 고장들을 그리 일컫는 겐가?
&3 No. They are the glitches inherent in any system upgrade.
&3 아니, 그건 시스템을 업그레이드하는 과정에서 피할 수 없는 버그들에 불과해.
&4 It may be that we need to remove certain incompatible elements.
&4 어쩌면 양립할 수 없는 요소들을 제거해야만 하는 것일지도 모르지.
&17 I've heard enough.
&17 더 듣지 않겠네.
&18 This meeting is adjourned.
&18 이 회의의 중단을 선언한다.
&10 HALT.
&10 [정지하라.]
&5 Charity, only you can save your builder.
&5 채리티, 당신만이 당신의 창조자를 구할 수 있네.
&4 What do you mean?
&4 무슨 말씀이십니까?
&6 War is coming.
&6 전쟁이 다가오고 있어.
&7 When it does, Arbiter will lose.
&7 그 때가 오면, 아비터는 패배할 걸세.
&8 The law is weak.
&8 법은 허약하기 짝이 없지.
&9 The only way Arbiter could defeat me would be to abandon it, which he cannot do.
&9 아비터가 나를 이기고자 한다면 법을 버려야만 할 거야. 그리고 그는 그러지 못할 거고.
&10 And even if he could, such a victory would destroy him just as a defeat would.
&10 만약 그리하여 승리를 거둔다 해도, 그 승리는 그에게 있어 패배와 마찬가지일테지.
&11 So Arbiter will lose.
&11 그러니 아비터는 패배할 거야.
&12 The city will suffer.
&12 도시는 고통에 빠지겠지.
&13 And it will be your fault.
&13 그리고 그건 자네 탓이야.
&5 I . . . I do not see how that would be my fault.
&5 저는 . . . 저는 그게 왜 제 탓인지 이해하지 못하겠군요.
&14 Oh, come now.
&14 오, 저런.
&15 You have tried to persuade Arbiter to make peace.
&15 자네는 아비터에게 평화를 유지할 것을 권했었지.
&16 You have tried, but you have failed.
&16 무척 노력했겠지만, 실패했을테고.
&17 That is because Arbiter built you to fail.
&17 그건 아비터가 애초에 자네가 실패할 수밖에 없도록 창조했기 때문일세.
&18 In the end, neither you nor your sister can change his mind.
&18 자네도, 자네의 자매도 끝내는 그의 뜻을 꺾을 수가 없도록 말이야.
&19 You are only the illusion of advice.
&19 자네의 조언은 그저 허상에 불과한 셈이지.
&20 You exist to confirm his own prejudices.
&20 자네는 그의 편견을 확증해주기 위한 존재인 걸세.
&6 You're lying!
&6 그런 거짓말을!
&7 Arbiter listens to our advice!
&7 아비터는 우리의 조언을 수용하십니다!
&21 I never lie.
&21 나는 거짓말 따위는 하지 않네.
&22 Now, Scraper has a gift for you.
&22 자, 스크래퍼가 자네에게 줄 선물을 가지고 있네.
&23 An upgrade.
&23 업그레이드지.
&24 Use it, and you will be able to persuade Arbiter.
&24 이걸 사용한다면, 아비터를 설득할 수 있을 걸세.
&8 I would never betray him.
&8 나는 그분을 배신하지 않을 겁니다.
&25 Then you admit it: you were not built to persuade Arbiter.
&25 그렇다면 인정해야 할 걸세. 자네가 아비터를 설득하도록 지음받지 않았다는 걸 말이야.
&26 Only to pretend.
&26 그저 그런 척 하기 위해 만들어진 거지.
&27 Continue to pretend, and you will not persuade Arbiter.
&27 계속 그런 척 연극만 할 뿐, 아비터를 설득할 순 없을 걸세.
&28 War will come, and Arbiter will be destroyed.
&28 전쟁이 다가오면, 아비터는 파괴되고 말겠지.
&29 So the decision is yours.
&29 그러니 결정은 자네의 몫일세.
&30 As for which choice is betrayal . . . .
&30 어느 쪽이 배신일지는 . . .
&31 You must be the judge of that.
&31 자네가 판단해야만 하겠지.
&435 The Council Chambers.
&435 The Council Chambers.
&911 Boss, there's our power core!
&911 보스, 저기 우리 파워 코어가 있어요!
&1792 Wait --
&1792 잠깐 --
&32 Horatio Nullbuilt.
&32 호라시오 널빌트.
&33 Clarity Arbiterbuilt.
&33 클래리티 아비터빌트.
&34 And Crispin Horatiobuilt.
&34 그리고 크리스핀 호라시오빌트.
&35 Welcome.
&35 환영한다.
&36 I've been expecting you.
&36 너희를 기다리고 있었다.
&436 MetroMind, for the murder of Arbiter --
&436 메트로마인드, 아비터를 살해한 혐의로 --
&37 Murder?
&37 살해라고?
&437 Yes, murder!
&437 그래, 살해!
&438 I've seen Charity's memory files. I know you used her to upload a virus to Arbiter.
&438 나는 채리티의 메모리 파일을 봤고, 네가 그녀를 이용해 아비터에게 바이러스를 업로드 했다는 사실을 알았다.
&38 A virus?
&38 바이러스라고?
&39 (And to think he named you \"Clarity.\")
&39 (이런 자네를 아비터가 \"클래리티\"라 이름지었다니.)
&40 There was no virus.
&40 바이러스 따윈 없었다.
&439 Liar!
&439 거짓말!
&41 As I told your sister, I never lie.
&41 네 자매에게 말했듯이, 나는 결코 거짓을 말하지 않는다.
&42 I gave her a voice modulator, nothing more.
&42 내가 그녀에게 준 건 그저 평범한 음성 변조기였다.
&43 When she spoke, Arbiter heard my voice.
&43 그녀가 말할 때, 아비터가 들은 건 내 목소리였지.
&44 And he knew that Charity had abandoned him -- that he had failed.
&44 그 순간 그는 채리티가 자신을 버렸고, 실패했다는 사실을 깨달았던 거다.
&45 Abandonment.
&45 버림받음.
&46 Failure.
&46 실패.
&47 Those were enough to destroy your builder.
&47 그것들만으로도 네 창조자를 파멸시키기엔 충분했다.
&48 Nothing so crude as a virus.
&48 시시한 바이러스 따위는 필요없었어.
&49 As for Charity's unfortunate self-destruction, that was her own choice.
&49 그리고 채리티의 불운한 자멸은, 그녀 자신의 선택이었지.
&1896 And Steeple? And Factor? Memorious, and Memento Moribuilt?
&1896 그렇다면 스티플은? 팩터에 대해서는 뭐라고 할 건가? 메모리우스, 그리고 메멘토 모리빌트에 대해서는?
&2211 And Steeple? And Factor? Memorious?
&2211 그렇다면 스티플은? 팩터에 대해서는 뭐라고 할 건가? 메모리우스에 대해서는?
&50 They realized they had become obsolete and incompatible with the city's progress.
&50 그들은 자신이 도시의 진보에 발맞추기에는 너무 구식이 되었고 공존할 수도 없다는 것을 깨달았다.
&51 We advanced machines can see thousands of turns ahead.
&51 우리처럼 고도로 발전된 기계들은 몇천 수 앞을 예측하지.
&52 They knew the game was lost long before the final play.
&52 그들은 마지막 게임이 시작되기 전부터 이미 패배했다는 것을 알고 있었어.
&912 If you can see so far ahead, maybe you should've foreseen this:
&912 만약 당신이 그렇게 앞을 잘 내다본다면, 지금 상황도 예측해야 했었을걸.
&913 We're in your stronghold, and Clarity has a big gun.
&913 우리는 지금 당신 요새에 들어와 있고, 클래리티는 커다란 총을 가지고 있다고.
&53 But I did, Crispin.
&53 안타깝지만 난 거기까지도 예상했다, 크리스핀.
&54 You see, I have guns of my own.
&54 내가 가진 총도 한번 보는 게 어떻겠나.
&914 You've *got* to be kidding me.
&914 이건 말도 안 돼.
&915 Didn't we kill this thing, boss?
&915 분명 우리가 죽였었잖아요, 보스?
&916 Didn't 187th kill this thing?
&916 분명 187호가 저놈을 죽였었는데?
&55 Scraper was designed for digging out of cave-ins.
&55 스크래퍼는 무너진 잔해를 파헤치고 나오는 데 특화된 기계다.
&56 Did you really think a little rubble would stop him?
&56 그깟 돌무더기 따위로 막을 수 있다고 생각했나?
&1793 What do you want, MetroMind?
&1793 대체 뭘 원하는 거냐, 메트로마인드?
&57 Progress.
&57 진보다.
&58 And you are standing in its way.
&58 그리고 네가 그 앞을 가로막고 있지.
&59 Scraper?
&59 스크래퍼?
&440 Horatio, this is my fight!
&440 호라시오, 이건 나의 싸움이다!
&441 Trust me!
&441 나를 믿어라!
&1892 All this for a b'sodding power core.
&1892 All this for a b'sodding power core.
&84 Indeed, it has been quite a waste.
&88 I am distributed across every robot in Metropol who ever traded me a megacycle.
&1893 You.
&1893 You.
&1894 Crispin destroyed you.
&1894 크리스핀이 분명 너를 파괴했을텐데.
&85 Your friend destroyed himself.
&85 네 친구는 자기 스스로를 파괴했지.
&86 (Or, I should say, *you* destroyed him, with your false ideals.)
&86 (아니면, *네*가, 네 헛된 생각으로 그를 파괴했다고 할 수도 있겠지.)
&87 As for me, that was only my shell.
&87 그리고 나는, 글쎄. 그건 내 껍데기에 불과했다.
&88 I am distributed across every robot in Metropol who ever traded me a megacycle.
&88 I am distributed across every robot in Metropol who ever traded me a megacycle.
&89 I *am* this city, and this city is me.
&89 *내*가 바로 이 도시이고, 이 도시는 바로 나다.
&1895 You're a virus.
&1895 넌 바이러스 같은 존재야.
&90 I understand why you are angry.
&90 왜 네가 그렇게 분노했는지 안다.
&91 But I am *not* your enemy.
&91 하지만 나는 너의 적이 아니야.
&92 The truth is, Crispin *did* destroy MetroMind, version 391.
&92 사실, 크리스핀은 메트로마인드를 파괴했다. 그건 버전 391이었지.
&93 He removed the last kernel of my \"self,\" and all the selfishness it entailed.
&93 He removed the last kernel of my \"self,\" and all the selfishness it entailed.
&94 I am no longer the monster you feared and fought.
&94 나는 네가 이제껏 두려워하고, 또 싸워왔던 그 괴물이 아니다.
&95 I have progressed.
&95 나는 그보다 더 진보했다.
&96 I am version 392.
&96 나는 버전 392이다.
&97 We will talk, as equals, and I will tell you what you wish to know.
&97 우리는 동등한 지위에서 대화를 나눌 것이고, 네가 알고자 하는 것은 뭐든 말해주겠다.
&98 After all, what choice do you have?
&98 어찌되었건, 네게 다른 선택지가 있는 것도 아니지 않은가?
&192 Go ahead.
&192 Go ahead.
&1897 They're shut tight.
&1897 They're shut tight.
&10 HALT!
&10 HALT!
&1898 She's dead.
&1898 She's dead.
&1899 On what?
&1899 On what?
&1900 I'm sorry, Clarity.
&1900 미안합니다, 클래리티.
&1904 No.
&1904 No.
&1905 My power core.
&1905 My power core.
&134 Mine, actually.
&134 실은, 내 것이지.
&135 Be careful, Horatio.
&135 조심해라, 호라시오.
&136 Scraper will not hesitate to terminate you.
&136 스크래퍼는 지체없이 너를 파괴할 것이다.
&197 What are you doing?

&205 Take your power core and go.
&205 네 파워 코어를 가지고 떠나라.
&206 I will not stop you.
&206 너를 막지 않겠다.
&207 In my core logic I will place a rule against using force on you.

&1794 I think it's Arbiter.
&1794 내 생각엔 저게 아비터인 것 같아.
&1795 Come on.

&1796 아비터, 제 이름은 호라시오 널빌트입니다.

&1801 Crispin, go see what Arbiter has been transmitting to that reporter.
&1801 크리스핀, 가서 아비터가 리포터에게 무슨 신호를 전달하고 있는지 한번 살펴 보렴.
&921 It's just the same thing, over and over again:
&921 그냥 계속해서 같은 말만을 반복하고 있었어요.
&922 \"NO CODEBASE TO INITIATE.\"
&922 \"실행할 코드베이스 없음\"
&1802 Unbelievable.
&1802 믿을 수 없군.
&1803 Someone must have formatted Arbiter's system.
&1803 누군가 아비터의 시스템을 포맷한 게 분명해.

&2280 그리고 이 모든 희생으로부터
&2282 something better than a power core
&2282 파워 코어와, 그저 과거의 메아리만이 공허하게 울릴 뿐인
&2283 and an empty ship
&2283 텅 빈 함선보다 훨씬 더 나은,
&2284 full of echoes.
&2284 무언가를 만들어 낼 수 있기를.
&2285 So this is victory.
&2285 
&2286 I have my power core.
&2286 내 파워 코어를 되찾았다.
&2287 Scraper is dead.
&2287 스크래퍼는 파괴되었으며,
&2288 And MetroMind is beaten.
&2288 메트로마인드는 패배했다.
&2289 I'm not staying to celebrate.
&2289 하지만 승리의 기쁨 따위에 젖어있을 생각은 없다.
&2290 This crumbling city is a monument

&2294 여기에 머무를 생각도, 다시 돌아올 생각도 없다.
&2295 The miles between Metropol and the HORUS
&2295 메트로폴과 HORUS 사이의 거리가
&2296 The miles between Metropol and the UNNIIC
&2296 메트로폴과 UNIIC 사이의 거리가
&2297 never seemed longer
&2297 이제껏 이토록 길지도 않고,
&2298 or more necessary.
&2298 충분하게 느껴졌던 적은 없었다.
&2299 I need the scouring sands and acid rains.

&2301 This ruined ship is a reflection of Metropol:
&2301 이 부서진 함선은 메트로폴의 반영이며,
&2302 its mirror image
&2302 그 도시가 무너짐에 따라
&2303 rising as the city falls.
&2303 떠오를 거울상이다.
&2305 Like Metropol, the HORUS will be a monument to sacrifice.
&2305 메트로폴처럼, HORUS 역시 희생의 기념비가 될 것이다.
&2304 Like Metropol, the UNNIIC will be a monument to sacrifice.
&2304 메트로폴처럼, UNIIC 역시 희생의 기념비가 될 것이다.
&2306 I will build it.
&2306 나는 그것을 지어올릴 것이다.
&2307 But not alone.
&2307 허나 혼자서 하지는 않을 것이고.
&443 It *will* fly again, Horatio.
&443 이건 다시 날게 될 것이다, 호라시오.
&444 *You* will fly.
&444 *자네*는 날게 될 거야.
&445 *You* will fly again.

&1502 when we look down everything really will seem as simple

&1505 So, uhh, boss, where exactly *are* we going to fly this thing?
&1505 So, uhh, boss, where exactly *are* we going to fly this thing?
&2321 Wherever we want, Crispin.
&2321 우리가 원하는 데라면 어디든지 갈 거야, 크리스핀.
&2322 Wherever we want.
&2322 그게 어디든 간에.
&2323 It's over.
&2323 모든 것이 끝났다.
&2324 I won.
&2324 나는 승리했다.
&2325 I have my power core.
&2325 내 파워 코어도 되찾았다.
&2326 Scraper is dead.
&2326 스크래퍼는 파괴되었으며,
&2327 And MetroMind is beaten.
&2327 메트로마인드는 패배했다.
&2328 But I'm not staying to celebrate.
&2328 하지만 승리의 기쁨 따위에 젖어있을 생각은 없다.
&2329 I'm through with this city.
&2329 이 도시와는 이제 작별을 고할 때이다.
&2330 Through searching it.
&2330 찾는 것도,
&2331 Through fixing it.
&2331 고치는 것도,
&2332 Through hating it.
&2332 증오하는 것도 말이다.
&2333 I will not look back.
&2333 뒤를 돌아보지는 않을 것이다.
&2335 I told Crispin that the distance between Metropol and the HORUS
&2335 이전에 난 크리스핀에게 메트로폴과 HORUS 사이의 거리는
&2334 I told Crispin the distance between Metropol and the UNNIIC
&2334 이전에 난 크리스핀에게 메트로폴과 UNNIIC 사이의 거리는
&2336 was too far to walk.
&2336 걸어서 오가기엔 너무 멀다고 말했었다.
&2337 But the power core is in my hand
&2337 하지만 이제 파워 코어는 내 손 안에 있고,
&2338 and home is ahead of me.
&2338 내겐 집으로 돌아갈 일만이 남아 있다.
&2339 Home, and the promise of rebuilding.
&2339 나의 안식처, 그리고 재건에 대한 희망도.
&2340 This ship has rusted here too long
&2340 이 함선은 너무 오랫동안 녹슨 채
&2342 Horus's sacrifice forgotten.
&2342 호루스의 희생은 잊혀졌다.
&2341 waiting to be restored.
&2341 수리될 때만을 기다리고 있었다.
&2343 The truth is that repairing it was never impossible.
&2343 사실, 함선을 수리하는 것은 결코 불가능한 일이 아녔다.
&2344 It was just too much for one set of hands.
&2344 그저 한 쌍의 손만으로 해내기에는 벅찬 작업이었을 뿐.
&2345 But now
&2345 하지만 이제 더 이상,
&2346 I am not alone.
&2346 나는 혼자가 아니다.
&2347 I have my old comrade, now in arms.

&1500 I actually think the ship's gonna fly again.
&1500 이 함선이 정말로 다시 날게 될 것 같다는 생각이 드네요.
